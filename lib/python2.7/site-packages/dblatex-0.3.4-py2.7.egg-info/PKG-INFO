Description: 
               dblatex is a program that transforms your SGML/XML DocBook documents to
               DVI, PostScript or PDF by translating them into pure LaTeX as a first
               process.  MathML 2.0 markups are supported, too. It started as a clone
               of DB2LaTeX.
