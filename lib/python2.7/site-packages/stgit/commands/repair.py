help = 'Fix StGit metadata if branch was modified with git commands'
kind = 'stack'
usage = ['']
description = """
If you modify an StGit stack (branch) with some git commands -- such
as commit, pull, merge, and rebase -- you will leave the StGit
metadata in an inconsistent state. In that situation, you have two
options:

  1. Use "stg undo" to undo the effect of the git commands. (If you
     know what you are doing and want more control, "git reset" or
     similar will work too.)

  2. Use "stg repair". This will fix up the StGit metadata to
     accomodate the modifications to the branch. Specifically, it will
     do the following:

       * If you have made regular git commits on top of your stack of
         StGit patches, "stg repair" makes new StGit patches out of
         them, preserving their contents.

       * However, merge commits cannot become patches; if you have
         committed a merge on top of your stack, "repair" will simply
         mark all patches below the merge unapplied, since they are no
         longer reachable. If this is not what you want, use "stg
         undo" to get rid of the merge and run "stg repair" again.

       * The applied patches are supposed to be precisely those that
         are reachable from the branch head. If you have used e.g.
         "git reset" to move the head, some applied patches may no
         longer be reachable, and some unapplied patches may have
         become reachable. "stg repair" will correct the appliedness
         of such patches.

     "stg repair" will fix these inconsistencies reliably, so as long
     as you like what it does, you have no reason to avoid causing
     them in the first place. For example, you might find it
     convenient to make commits with a graphical tool and then have
     "stg repair" make proper patches of the commits.

NOTE: If using git commands on the stack was a mistake, running "stg
repair" is _not_ what you want. In that case, what you want is option
(1) above."""
