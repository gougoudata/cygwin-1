Squash two or more patches, creating one big patch that contains all
their changes. In more detail:

  1. Pop all the given patches, plus any other patches on top of them.

  2. Push the given patches in the order they were given on the
     command line.

  3. Squash the given patches into one big patch.

  4. Allow the user to edit the commit message of the new patch
     interactively.

  5. Push the other patches that were popped in step (1).

Conflicts can occur whenever we push a patch; that is, in step (2) and
(5). If there are conflicts, the command will stop so that you can
resolve them."""
