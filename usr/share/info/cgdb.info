Summary of CGDB
***************

CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB).  The goal
of CGDB is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with
unnecessary features.

   The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text
interface, with a split screen showing the source as it executes.  The
UI is modeled on the classic Unix text editor, vi.  Those familiar with
vi should feel right at home using CGDB.

   The library responsible for communicating with GDB is called Trivial
GDB (tgdb, or more accurately, libtgdb).  This abstraction allows the
UI code to be independent of the debugger, as well as greatly
simplifying its implementation.

   Those wanting to develop other interfaces to GDB are welcome to use
libtgdb as the basis for their program.  Many of the headaches of
parsing GDB's output and annotations can be avoided by using it.

   Some features offered by CGDB are:

   * Syntax-highlighted source window

   * Visual breakpoint setting

   * Keyboard shortcuts for common functions

   * Searching source window (using regexp)

1 Getting In and Out of CGDB
****************************

This chapter discusses how to start CGDB, and how to get out of it.
The essentials are:
   * type `cgdb' to start CGDB.

   * type `quit' or `C-d' in the GDB window to exit.

   * type `:quit' in the source window to exit.  This even works if GDB
     is currently hanging, or operating a long command.

2 Understanding the core concepts of CGDB
*****************************************

The CGDB user interface currently consists of two windows and a status
bar.  The source window is currently on the top and the GDB window is
on the bottom.  The "status bar" currently separates the two windows.

   The interface has several modes depending on which window is focused.
"CGDB mode" is when the source window is focused, "GDB mode" is when
the GDB window is focused and "TTY mode" is when the TTY window is
focused.

   Beginning with CGDB version 1.0, the windows are movable, and the
user will be able to create as many or as few that is desired.
Currently however, all of my time is spent developing the interface
between CGDB and GDB. Once this is complete, the UI of CGDB will become
much more polished.  If you are a ncurses developer, and have spare
time to work on this task, please contact me.

2.1 Understanding the source window.
====================================

The "source window" is the window that provides you a view of the source
code that the debugged program is made up of.  It will display to the
user a single source file at a time.  While the user is debugging, via
`next' and `step', CGDB will update the source file and line number to
keep you informed as to where GDB is debugging.

   CGDB has several features that make debugging easier than using
plain old GDB.  One feature you will notice right away while debugging
a C, C++ or ADA program, is that the source files are syntax
highlighted.  This allows the user to easily navigate through the
source file to look for certain places in the source code.  If you
would like to see another source language highlighted, contact us.  To
understanding how to navigate through the source window look at the
commands in *note CGDB Mode::.

   In addition to showing the source code, CGDB also displays to the
user the currently executing line. The line number will be highlighted
green, to represent that the particular line, is the current line being
debugged by GDB.  Also, CGDB will display an arrow extending from the
line number, to the source line.  You can configure what type of arrow
CGDB uses with the `:set arrowstyle' configuration option. By default,
the `short' arrow is used.  However, my personal favorite is the `long'
arrow.

   As you navigate through the source window, the current line the
cursor is on will be highlighted white.  This simply helps you keep
track of where you are in the file.

   Also, you can set or delete breakpoints in CGDB from the source
window.  Simply navigate to the line that you are interested in setting
a breakpoint, and hit the space bar.  This will set a breakpoint on the
line if one did not already exist.  The line number should turn red to
indicate that a breakpoint has been set.  Hitting the space bar again
will delete the breakpoint.  If you disable the breakpoint, the line
number will turn yellow, to represent the disabled breakpoint.

   CGDB also supports regular expression searching within the source
window.  If you type `/' or `?' you can search in the source window for
a string of interest.  The C library regular expression functions are
used to perform this search, which honors things like `*' or `+'.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note CGDB Mode::.

2.2 Understanding the GDB window.
=================================

The "GDB window" is how CGDB allows the user to interface with the GNU
debugger.  If you wish to pass a command to GDB, simply type it into
this window and GDB will receive the command.  This interface is
intended to be 100% identical to using GDB on a terminal.

   There is a limited set of keys that can be typed into this window
that CGDB interprets and handles, instead of sending to GDB.  They are
all available in *note GDB Mode::.

   CGDB attempts to buffer commands the same way they would be if you
typed them at the terminal.  So, if you type several commands before a
single one finishes, they will each be run in order.  There will be no
way to stop these commands from being run besides from typing `Ctrl-C',
like you would at any normal terminal when working with GDB.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: File Dialog Window,  Next: TTY Window,  Prev: GDB Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.3 Understanding the file dialog window.
=========================================

The "file dialog window" is available to help the user view and select
which file they would like to view.  It provides the user with a list
of all the files that make up the program being debugged.  If there are
no files available, because there is no program being debugged or
because there is no debug symbols, then the file dialog will not open
and a message will be displayed at the status bar.

   You can get to the file dialog by hitting `o' when you are at the
source window.  Once you enter the file dialog, it is possible to leave
it by hitting `q'.  You can navigate the file dialog using the standard
direction keys and you can even use regular expression to find your
file.  This can save a lot of time as the number of files grow.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note File Dialog Mode::.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: TTY Window,  Next: Status Bar,  Prev: File Dialog Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.4 Understanding the TTY window.
=================================

The "TTY window" is available to allow the user to pass input to the
program being debugged. This window will act similar to the GDB window,
except that the data you type will get sent to the program being
debugged.  *Note Sending I/O to Inferior::.

   You will notice that the TTY window has a terminal device between it
and the program being debugged.  So, if the program being debugged uses
say readline, which allows command line editing, the same interface
will be provided via the TTY window as at the terminal.  You can see
the name of the terminal device in the TTY status bar.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note TTY Mode::.

   Sending I/O to the program being debugged can be confusing.  It is
described better in *note Sending I/O to Inferior::.  Unless the I/O
with the program being debugged is simple, I usually prefer starting
the application on a separate terminal and attaching to it with CGDB.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: Status Bar,  Next: Switching Windows,  Prev: TTY Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.5 Understanding the status bar.
=================================

The "status bar" is the general purpose way for CGDB to show the user
which commands they are currently typing or report errors to the user
when they occur.  CGDB does not use popup's or other forms of I/O to
alert the user of information or problems.

   While CGDB is running, you can configure it with any of the commands
that are valid in CGDB's configuration file.  Simply type `:' in the
source window, and you will see the colon, and the rest of the command
you type appear in the status bar.  When you are finished typing the
command that you are interested in, type `enter'.  This will alert CGDB
to execute the command.  If at any point you would like to cancel the
current command typed so far, type the cgdb mode key.  This will put
you back into CGDB mode.  For a description of the cgdb mode key, see
*note Switching Windows::.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note Configuring CGDB::.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: Switching Windows,  Prev: Status Bar,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.6 Switch between windows
==========================

When CGDB is invoked, the interface is in "GDB mode".  A `*' at the
right of the status bar indicates that input will be passed to GDB.  To
change the focus to the source window, hit the <ESC> key.  The "cgdb
mode key" is the key that is responsible for switching the user into
"CGDB mode" from a different mode.  The cgdb mode key is defaulted to
the <ESC> key.  To change this value, look at the configuration options
for CGDB.  *Note Configuring CGDB::.

   The interface is now in "CGDB mode".  To switch back into "GDB mode",
press `i'.  This syntax is based on the popular Unix text-editor, vi.

3 CGDB commands
***************

CGDB can be controlled in a variety of different ways.  Each mode that
CGDB is in acts differently. Currently CGDB implicitly changes modes
depending on which window is active.  The following information will
help you determine what commands are accessible during which modes.

* Menu:

* CGDB Mode::                   Commands available during CGDB mode
* GDB Mode::                    Commands available during GDB mode
* File Dialog Mode::            Commands available during the file dialog mode
* TTY Mode::                    Commands available during TTY mode


File: cgdb.info,  Node: CGDB Mode,  Next: GDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.1 Commands available during CGDB mode
=======================================

When you are in the source window, you are implicitly in "CGDB mode".
All of the below commands are available during this mode.  This mode is
primarily available for the user to view the current source file,
search it, or switch to a different mode.

`cgdbmodekey'
     Puts the user into command mode. However, you are already in this
     mode.  This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`i'
     Puts the user into "GDB mode".

`I'
     Puts the user into "TTY mode".

`T'
     Opens a window to give input to the debugged program.

`Ctrl-T'
     Opens a new tty for the debugged program.

`k'
`up arrow'
     Move up a line.

`j'
`down arrow'
     Move down a line.

`h'
`left arrow'
     Move left a line.

`l'
`right arrow'
     Move right a line.

`Ctrl-b'
`page up'
     Move up a page.

`Ctrl-u'
     Move up 1/2 a page.

`-'
     Shrink source window 1 line.

`='
     Grow source window 1 line.

`_'
     Shrink source window 25% (or, shrink tty window 1 line, if
     visible).

`+'
     Grow source window 25% (or, grow tty window 1 line, if visible).

`Ctrl-l'
     Clear and redraw the screen.

`F5'
     Send a run command to GDB.

`F6'
     Send a continue command to GDB.

File: cgdb.info,  Node: GDB Mode,  Next: File Dialog Mode,  Prev: CGDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.2 Commands available during GDB mode
======================================

When in "GDB mode", the user is mostly interested in working with the
GDB console.  That is, sending commands to GDB and receiving data back
from GDB.  Almost all data passed into this window is directly sent to
readline and then to GDB.

   It is important to understand that CGDB parses the keys entered in
the GDB window and has the first chance at dealing with them.  If it is
interested in the keys, it will handle them. Below is a list of keys
that CGDB is interested in, and does not pass along any further.

`cgdbmodekey'
     Switch back to source window.  This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`page up'
     Move up a page.

`page down'
     Move down a page.

`F11'
     Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

`F12'
     Go to the end of the GDB buffer.

   Any other keys, besides the ones above, CGDB is currently not
interested in.  CGDB will pass along these keys to the readline
library. When readline has determined that a command has been received,
it alerts CGDB, and a command is then sent to GDB. This is the same
method used when invoking GDB directly.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: File Dialog Mode,  Next: TTY Mode,  Prev: GDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.3 Commands available during the file dialog mode
==================================================

The file dialog is primarily used to allow the user to find and open a
source file that the program they are debugging is made up of.  The
file dialog will be full screen, and will list each file that the
debugged program is made up of.  A usual instance of the file dialog
would be to open it up from the source window using the `o' key, and
then to search for the file of interest. If you are looking for foo.c
type `/foo.c', press `enter' once to finish the regular expression and
again to select the file.

   The commands available in the file dialog are:

`q'
     Will exit the file dialog, and return to the source window.

`k'
`up arrow'
     Move up a line.

`j'
`down arrow'
     Move down a line.

`h'
`left arrow'
     Move left a line.

`l'
`right arrow'
     Move right a line.

`Ctrl-b'
`page up'
     Move up a page.

`Ctrl-f'
`page down'
     Move down a page.

`/'
     search from current cursor position.

`?'
     reverse search from current cursor position.

`n'
     next forward search.

`N'
     next reverse search.

`enter'
     Select the current file.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: TTY Mode,  Prev: File Dialog Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.4 Commands available during TTY mode
======================================

`cgdbmodekey'
     Switch back to source window. This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`page up'
     Move up a page.

`page down'
     Move down a page.

`F11'
     Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

`F12'
     Go to the end of the GDB buffer.

4 CGDB configuration commands
*****************************

There may be several features that you find useful in CGDB.  CGDB is
capable of automating any of these commands through the use of the
config file called `cgdbrc'.  It looks in `$HOME'`/.cgdb/' for that
file.  If it exists, CGDB executes each line in the file in order.  It
is as if the user typed in all the commands into the status bar after
the tui was initialized.

   The following variables change the behavior of some aspect of CGDB.
Many of these commands may be abbreviated in some way, and all boolean
commands my be negated by appending `no' to the front.  For example:
`:set ignorecase' turns on case-insensitive searching; while `:set
noignorecase' turns on case-sensitive searching.

`:set as=STYLE'
`:set arrowstyle=STYLE'
     Set the arrow style to STYLE.  Possible values for STYLE are
     `short', `long', and `highlight'.  Changes the style of the arrow
     that is used to indicate the currently executing line in the source
     viewer.  The default value is short.  A longer arrow is available,
     for easier readability.  Finally, the `highlight' option draws no
     arrow at all, instead drawing the entire line in inverse video.

`:set asr'
`:set autosourcereload'
     If this is on, CGDB will automatically reload a source file if it
     has changed since CGDB has opened it.  If it is off, the file will
     never be reloaded, until you start CGDB again. The default is on.
     This feature is useful when you are debugging a program, then you
     modify a source file, recompile, and type `r' in GDB's CLI window.
     The file in this case will be updated to show the new version.
     Note, CGDB only looks at the timestamp of the source file to
     determine if it has changed. So if you modify the source file, and
     didn't recompile yet, CGDB will still pick up on the changes.

`:set cgdbmodekey=KEY'
     This option is used to determine what key puts CGDB into "CGDB
     Mode".  By default, the `ESC' key is used.  KEY can be any normal
     key on the keyboard.  It can also be any keycode, as long as the
     keycode notation is used.  This option is especially useful when
     the user wants to use readline in vi mode.  If the user types `set
     cgdbmodekey=<PageUp>' then the `Page Up' key will put CGDB into
     CGDB mode and the `ESC' key will flow through to readline.

`:set ic'
`:set ignorecase'
     Sets searching case insensitive.  The default is off.

`:set stc'
`:set showtgdbcommands'
     If this is on, CGDB will show all of the commands that it sends to
     GDB.  If it is off, CGDB will not show the commands that it gives
     to GDB.  The default is off.

`:set syn=STYLE'
`:set syntax=STYLE'
     Sets the current highlighting mode of the current file to have the
     syntax STYLE.  Possible values for SYNTAX are `c', `ada', and
     `off'.  Normally, the user will never have to do this, since CGDB
     automatically detects what syntax a file should be based on its
     file extension.  However, this feature can currently be useful for
     debugging purposes.

`:set to'
`:set timeout'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUT option to determine the
     behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of a mapped key
     sequence or a keyboard code sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB
     will time out on both user defined mappings and on key codes from
     the keyboard.  If this option is off, user defined mappings will
     not be timed out on.  In this case, CGDB will determine if it
     should time out on key codes from the keyboard by examining the
     TTIMEOUT option.  To determine how CGDB will time out on mappings
     and key codes, and what time out lengths CGDB will use, please
     refer to the chart in *note Key User Interface::.  The default
     value for this option is on.

`:set tm=DELAY'
`:set timeoutlen=DELAY'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUTLEN option.  It
     represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a
     key code from the keyboard or for a mapped key sequence to
     complete.  If DELAY is 0, CGDB immediately accepts each character
     it receives.  This will prevent any mappings or key codes to
     complete.  DELAY may be any value between 0 and 10000, inclusive.
     The default setting for the DELAY variable is 1000 (one second).

`:set ttimeout'
     This option is used along with the TIMEOUT option to determine the
     behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of keyboard code
     sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB will time out on key codes
     from the keyboard.  If this option is off, CGDB will determine if
     it should time out on key codes from the keyboard by examining the
     TIMEOUT option.  To determine how CGDB will time out on key codes,
     what what time length it will use, please refer to the chart in
     *note Key User Interface::.  The default value for this option is
     on.

`:set ttm=DELAY'
`:set ttimeoutlen=DELAY'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUTLEN option.  It
     represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a
     key code from the keyboard.  If DELAY is 0, CGDB immediately
     accepts each character it receives.  This will prevent any key
     codes to complete.  DELAY may be any value between 0 and 10000,
     inclusive.  The default setting for the DELAY variable is 100 (one
     tenth of a second).

`:set ts=NUMBER'
`:set tabstop=NUMBER'
     Sets the number of spaces that should be rendered on the screen
     for <TAB> characters.  The default value for NUMBER is 8.

`:set wmh=NUMBER'
`:set winminheight=NUMBER'
     The minimal height of a window.  Windows will never become smaller
     than this value.  The default value for NUMBER is 0.

`:set winsplit=STYLE'
     Set the split point between source and GDB window.  This is
     especially useful as an init setting in your `cgdbrc' file.  *Note
     Configuring CGDB::.  The possible values for STYLE are `top_full',
     `top_big', `even', `bottom_big', and `bottom_full'.

`:set ws'
`:set wrapscan'
     Searches wrap around the end of file.  The default is on.

`:c'
`:continue'
     Send a continue command to GDB.

`:down'
     Send a down command to GDB.

`:e'
`:edit'
     reloads the file in the source window.  this can be useful if the
     file has changed since it was opened by cgdb.

`:f'
`:finish'
     Send a finish command to GDB.

`:help'
     This will display the current manual in text format, in the
     "source window".

`:hi GROUP cterm=ATTRIBUTES ctermfg=COLOR ctermbg=COLOR term=ATTRIBUTES'
`:highlight GROUP cterm=ATTRIBUTES ctermfg=COLOR ctermbg=COLOR term=ATTRIBUTES'
     Set the COLOR and ATTRIBUTES for a highlighting group.  The syntax
     mimics vim's "highlight" command.  Possible values for GROUP,
     ATTRIBUTES and COLOR are available in *note Highlighting Groups::.

     You can give as many or as few of the name=value pairs as you
     wish, in any order.  `ctermfg' and `ctermbg' set the foreground
     and background colors.  These can be specified by color number or
     by using the same color names that vim uses.  When CGDB is linked
     with ncurses, the number you use to represent the color can be
     between -1 and COLORS.  When CGDB is linked against curses, it
     must be between 0 and COLORS.

     `cterm' sets the video attributes for color terminals.  `term' sets
     the video attributes for monochrome terminals.  Some examples are,
          :highlight Logo cterm=bold,underline ctermfg=Red ctermbg=Black
          :highlight Normal cterm=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=Black
          :hi Normal term=bold

`:insert'
     Move focus to the GDB window.

`:n'
`:next'
     Send a next command to GDB.

`:q'
`:quit'
     Quit CGDB.

`:r'
`:run'
     Send a run command to GDB.

`:start'
     Send a start command to GDB.

`:k'
`:kill'
     Send a kill command to GDB.

`:s'
`:step'
     Send a step command to GDB.

`:syntax'
     Turn the syntax on or off.

`:up'
     Send an up command to GDB.

`:map LHS RHS'
     Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in CGDB mode.
     After the command is run, if LHS is typed, CGDB will get RHS
     instead.  For more details on how to use the map command look in
     *note Using Maps::.

`:unm LHS'

`:unmap LHS'
     Delete an existing mapping from CGDB mode.  LHS is what was typed
     in the left hand side when the user created the mapping.  For
     example, if the user typed `:map a<Space>b foo' then the user
     could delete the existing mapping with `:unmap a<Space>b'.

`:im LHS RHS'
`:imap LHS RHS'
     Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in GDB mode.
     After the command is run, if LHS is typed, CGDB will get RHS
     instead.  For more details on how to use the map command look in
     *note Using Maps::.

`:iu LHS'

`:iunmap LHS'
     Delete an existing mapping from GDB mode.  LHS is what was typed
     in the left hand side when the user created the mapping.  For
     example, if the user typed `:imap a<Space>b foo' then the user
     could delete the existing mapping with `:iunmap a<Space>b'.

5 CGDB highlighting groups
**************************

CGDB is capable of using colors if the terminal it is run in supports
them.  Until version 0.6.1, CGDB did not allow the user to configure
these colors in any way.  CGDB color use is now fully configurable.

   CGDB's modeled its use of color highlighting after vim.  Any data
that will be colored in the terminal is represented by a highlighting
group.  A "highlighting group" represents data that should be formatted
using foreground colors, background colors and attributes.  There are
currently several types of highlighting groups in CGDB.  There are
syntax highlighting groups, which represent syntax highlighting of
sources files.  There are also User Interface groups, which represent
things like CGDB's logo, or the status bar.

   Each highlighting group has a default set of attributes and colors
associated with it.  You can modify a highlighting groups properties by
using the highlight command.  *Note Configuring CGDB::.

   Note that CGDB currently supports using the same background color
the terminal was using before CGDB was started.  However, this only
works when CGDB was linked with ncurses.  If you link CGDB with curses,
then CGDB will force the background to Black.

5.1 The different highlighting groups
=====================================

Below is a list of all the highlighting groups that CDGB will use when
syntax highlighting source files.

`Statement'
     This represents the keywords a language defines.

`Type'
     This represents the types a language defines.

`Constant'
     This represents either a string or numeric value.

`Comment'
     This represents the comments in a source file.

`PreProc'
     This represents the C/C++ preprocessor commands.

`Normal'
     This represents all normal text.

   Below is a list of all the highlighting groups that CGDB will use
when it is displaying it's User Interface.

`StatusLine'
     This represents the "status bar" in CGDB.  The file dialog's status
     bar also uses this group.

`IncSearch'
     This represents the group used when the user is searching in
     either the source window, or the "file dialog window".

`Arrow'
     This represents the arrow that CGDB draws to point to the
     currently viewed line.

`LineHighlight'
     This represents the group used when the user has the `arrowstyle'
     option set to `highlight'.

`Breakpoint'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB displays a line
     that has a breakpoint set.

`DisabledBreakpoint'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB displays a line
     that has a disabled breakpoint set.

`SelectedLineNr'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB is displaying the
     currently selected line.  This is the line that the cursor is on.

`Logo'
     This is the group CGDB uses to display its logo on startup when no
     source file can be auto detected.

5.2 The different attributes
============================

CGDB supports many of the attributes that curses provides.  It will
apply the attributes to the output window, but it is up to the terminal
you are using to support such features.

   The list of attributes that CGDB currently supports is below.

`normal'
`NONE'
     This will leave the text normal.  Uses A_NORMAL curses attribute.

`bold'
     This will make the text appear bold.  Uses A_BOLD curses attribute.

`underline'
     This will underline the text.  Uses A_UNDERLINE curses attribute.

`reverse'
`inverse'
     This will reverse the foreground and background colors.  Uses
     A_REVERSE curses attribute.

`standout'
     This is the best highlighting mode of the terminal.  Uses
     A_STANDOUT curses attribute.

`blink'
     This will cause the text to blink.  Uses A_BLINK curses attribute.

`dim'
     This will cause the text to be 1/2 bright.  Uses A_DIM curses
     attribute.

5.3 The different colors
========================

CGDB supports several colors, depending on how many colors your terminal
supports.  Below is a chart of the colors that CGDB provides.  The
heading NR-16 is used to represent terminals that support at least 16
colors.  The heading NR-8 is used to represent terminals that support
at least 8 colors.  The integer values for each color represent the
values passed to the curses function init_pair() to ask curses to
create a new color.

`COLOR NAME'                  `NR-16'        `NR-8'         `NR-8 bold

6 CGDB key user interface
*************************

The Key User Interface is how CGDB receives input from the user.  It is
usually referred to as the "KUI".  CGDB simply asks the KUI for the next
key the user typed and the KUI will provide it.

   The KUI has 2 major responsibilities besides reading normal user
input and providing it to CGDB.  It needs to detect when the user has
typed a user defined map or when the user has hit a special key on the
keyboard.

   A user defined map, or simply "map", is used to change the meaning
of typed keys.  Some users may refer to this type of functionality as a
"macro".  An example would be `map a b'.  If the user then typed the
<a> character, the KUI would detect that it was mapped to <b> and
return <b> to CGDB.

   When the user types a special key on the keyboard, a "key code" is
sent to CGDB.  Typically, keys like  `HOME', `DEL', <F1>, etc, when
pressed will send several characters to the application instead of just
one character like a normal key does.  These characters combined are
called a "key sequence".  The KUI is responsible for assembling the key
sequences back together and reporting to CGDB that a particular key was
typed by the user.  The `ESC' key is special because typically most key
codes start with that key.  This usually gives all key codes a common
first key in its key sequence.  The KUI uses the terminfo database to
determine what key sequences are sent by which keycodes.  There are a
few commonly used key sequences that are hard coded into CGDB.

   A major challenge the KUI has to overcome is determining when a map
or a key sequence is received.  The KUI sometimes will need to read
more than one character to determine this.  For example, if the user
has 2 maps, `map abc def' and `map abd def', the KUI would have to
buffer at least the characters <a> and <b> before it could determine if
the user was going to type a map.  After the next key press, if the
user types <c> or <d> then a map was received and the KUI will return
`d e f' to CGDB.  Otherwise, no map was received and the KUI must return
`a b' to CGDB.

   The options TIMEOUT, TTIMEOUT, TIMEOUTLEN and TTIMEOUTLEN can be
used to tell the KUI if it should timeout on partial mappings or key
sequences, and if so, how long it should wait before timing out.

* Configuring the KUI Time Out Options::        The KUI's time out options

File: cgdb.info,  Node: Configuring the KUI Time Out Options,  Next: Using Maps,  Up: Key User Interface

6.1 The KUI's time out options
==============================

The KUI may be configured to time out on either maps or key sequences.

   When the KUI is matching a partial map or key sequence it is capable
of timing out.  This means it will simply accepts the keys it has
received so far if a certain amount of time elapses between key
presses.  This is obvious when the user is typing a map because the
user must press each key individually.  For partial key sequences, this
is less obvious.  That is because the user only presses a single key,
but multiple characters are sent to CGDB.  The table below describes
how the user can configure the KUI to time out on key codes or maps.
The TIMEOUT and TTIMEOUT options control this functionality.

timeout     ttimeout    action
--------------------------------------------------------- 
off         off         do not time out
on          on or off   time out on maps and key codes
off         on          time out on key codes

   It is also possible to tell the KUI how long to wait before timing
out on a partial match.  If TIMEOUT is on, then the KUI will wait a
certain amount of time for the next character, when matching a map,
before it decides a match is no longer possible.  If TIMEOUT or
TTIMEOUT is on, then the KUI will wait a certain amount of time for the
next character, when matching a key sequence, before it decides a match
is no longer possible.  The TIMEOUTLEN and TTIMEOUTLEN options can be
configured by the user to tell the KUI how long to wait before timing
out.  The table below describes when the KUI uses which option.

timeoutlen  mapping delay  key code delay
------------------------------------------ 
< 0         TIMEOUTLEN     TIMEOUTLEN
>= 0        TIMEOUTLEN     TTIMEOUTLEN

   A value of 0 means that the KUI will time out right away.  It will
not be possible to match a map or key code in this circumstance.

   A common problem could be that when the user types a special key like
the left or right arrows, CGDB will go into the source mode and not
perform the action requested by the user.  This typically means that the
key code delay is to small.  If you try setting the option `set
ttimeoutlen=1000' CGDB should start acting like the user expects.  If
not, please report this to the CGDB mailing list.

6.2 Using maps
==============

CGDB fully supports the use of maps.  It allows the user to change the
meaning of typed keys. For example, you could have the following map
`:map <F2> ip<Space>argc<CR>'.

   When the user is in CGDB mode and they hit <F2>, the value of the map
will be used instead.  The `i' key will first be received by CGDB, and
it will put the user into insert mode.  Next, CGDB will get `p argc'
followed by the <Enter> key.

   CGDB currently supports two mapping lists.  Any mapping that was
added with the MAP command will be used by CGDB when it is in CGDB mode.
You can delete a mapping that you have created with the MAP command
with the UNMAP command.  If you want to have mappings in GDB mode, you
can use the IMAP command.  Similarly, IUNMAP will delete a mapping in
the IMAP set.  Some examples of this would be
     map a<Space>b foo
     unmap a<Space>b

     imap a<CR>b foo
     iunmap a<CR>b

6.3 Understanding keycodes
==========================

The above example could use a little more explaining for people
unfamiliar with vim maps.  The map takes a key and a value.  They are
separated by a space.  Neither the key or value can have a space in
them, or it is considered to be the separator between the key and
value.  If the user desires to have a space in either the key or value
part of a map, they can use the keycode notation <Space>.  Below is a
table of the keycodes in "keycode notation" form.  The keycode notation
can be used in any mapping command.

notation    meaning
------------------------------------------ 
<Esc>       escape key
<Up>        cursor up key
<Down>      cursor down key
<Left>      cursor left key
<Right>     cursor right key
<Home>      home key
<End>       end key
<PageUp>    page up key
<PageDown>  page down key
<Del>       delete key
<Insert>    insert key
<Nul>       zero
<Bs>        backspace key
<Tab>       tab key
<NL>        linefeed
<FF>        formfeed
<CR>        carriage return
<Space>     space
<Lt>        less-than
<Bslash>    backslash
<Bar>       vertical bar
<F1> -      function keys 1 to 12
<F12>       
<C-...>     control keys

7 Sending I/O to the program being debugged
*******************************************

If the program being debugged takes input on the terminal it is
recommended that the user start the program on one terminal, and attach
to it with CGDB from another terminal.  This is the easiest way to pass
input to the debugged program.

   However, if the user wishes to pass input to the program being
debugged from within CGDB, there is a mechanism available for doing so.
As of this writing, the technique described below does not work on
windows, using a natively compiled GDB.  It may work when using the GDB
that comes with Cygwin.

   This technique is similar to getting in and out of "GDB mode".  The
tty window is not visible by default.  This is because it is only
needed if the user wishes to send data to the program being debugged.
To display the tty window, hit `T' while in command mode.  After
hitting `T' you will notice that there is another window in the middle
of the "source window" and the "gdb window".  This is called the "tty
window". You will also see a new status bar called the tty status bar.
There will be a `*' on the tty status bar after the `T' was hit.  This
is because when the window is opened with the `T' command, CGDB
automatically puts the user into "TTY mode".  To get out of this window
hit the cgdb mode key.  This will put you back into command mode.  To
make the tty window appear and disappear hit the `T' key while in
command mode.  It is a toggle.

   Once the tty window is already open, the user can then hit `I' in
command mode to get into "TTY mode".  The user can then hit the cgdb
mode key in the "TTY mode" to get back into command mode.

   When the tty window is open, all data that comes from the program,
goes there.  Any data typed into the tty window will ONLY go to the
program being debugged.  It will not go to GDB. When the tty window is
closed, all output from the debugged program will go to the "GDB
window" AND to the "tty window" (for viewing later when the tty window
is opened).

   If the user wishes to get a new tty for the program being debugged
then they can type `Ctrl-T'.  This will delete all the buffered data
waiting to be read into the debugged program. This might be useful when
you rerun or start a new program.

8 Allowing terminal control flow in CGDB
****************************************

A user can typically set there control flow behavior by using the stty
command like so `stty -ixon -ixoff'.  This will disable control flow on
the terminal where CGDB is started.  If you want to turn control flow
back on you can type `stty ixon ixoff'.  If flow control is on, when
the user types `Ctrl-s', the terminal stops.  When the user types
`Ctrl-q', the terminal restarts.  When using readline, the `Ctrl-s'
character usually does a forward search.  So, if you want to get this,
or other functionality out of readline, simply turn off control flow
and start CGDB.

9 Building CGDB from source
***************************

Building CGDB from source requires several packages. First, CGDB is
hosted at http://sf.net/projects/cgdb. You can determine how to get
CGDB from source by looking here:
http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72581.

   Once you have the source to CGDB, now you can begin to build it.
You will of course need many packages to build CGDB. Below is a list of
all of them that are required to build CGDB.

`GNU Make'
     I have successfully used version 3.79.1, however, older versions
     probably will work.

`GNU GCC'
     The GNU C compiler. I've compiled CGDB with versions as old as
     2.9.5, and as new as 4.0.2.

`GNU Readline'
     The GNU readline library version 5.1. CGDB will not work with
     versions before 5.1.  Readline was modified specifically to work
     with CGDB.

`GNU Ncurses'
     I have successfully used libncurses.so.5 successfully.  However,
     older versions probably will work.

   Below is a list of optional packages you will need, if modifying
certain files in CGDB.

`GNU Flex'
     If you modify any files with an extension of `.l', you will have
     to have flex installed.  I have used flex 2.5.4 to build CGDB.

`GNU Texinfo'
     If you modify `doc/cgdb.texinfo', then you will be required to
     have this package installed.  I have used version 4.7 to build the
     documentation for CGDB.

`help2man'
     If you are doing a release, then you will be required to have this
     package installed.  In the `doc/' build directory, you can execute
     the command `make cgdb.1', and the CGDB man page will be generated.

   CGDB uses autoconf/automake to build its configure scripts and
makefiles.  So, if you change any of the autoconf/automake files, you
will need this software installed.

`GNU Automake'
     This has the program aclocal, and must be version Version 1.9.5.

`GNU Autoconf'
     This has the program autoconf, and must be version 2.59.

`GNU m4'
     This has the program m4, and must be version 1.4.3.

     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
