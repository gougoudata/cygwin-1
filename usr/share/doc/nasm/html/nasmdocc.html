<h2><a name="appendix-C">Appendix C: NASM Version History</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section-C.1">C.1 NASM 2 Series</a></h3>
<p>The NASM 2 series support x86-64, and is the production version of NASM
since 2007.
<h4><a name="section-C.1.1">C.1.1 Version 2.10.05</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Add the <code><nobr>CLAC</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>STAC</nobr></code> instructions.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.2">C.1.2 Version 2.10.04</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Add back the inadvertently deleted 256-bit version of the
<code><nobr>VORPD</nobr></code> instruction.
<li>Correct disassembly of instructions starting with byte
<code><nobr>82</nobr></code> hex.
<li>Fix corner cases in token pasting, for example:
</ul>
<p><pre>
   %define N 1e%++%+ 5 
           dd N, 1e+5
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.3">C.1.3 Version 2.10.03</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Correct the assembly of the instruction:
</ul>
<p><pre>
XRELEASE MOV [absolute],AL
</pre>
<p>Previous versions would incorrectly generate
<code><nobr>F3 A2</nobr></code> for this instruction and issue a warning;
correct behavior is to emit <code><nobr>F3 88 05</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-C.1.4">C.1.4 Version 2.10.02</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Add the <code><nobr>ifunc</nobr></code> macro package with integer
functions, currently only integer logarithms. See
<a href="nasmdoc5.html#section-5.4">section 5.4</a>.
<li>Add the <code><nobr>RDSEED</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>ADCX</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>ADOX</nobr></code>
instructions.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.5">C.1.5 Version 2.10.01</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Add missing VPMOVMSKB instruction with reg32, ymmreg operands.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.6">C.1.6 Version 2.10</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>When optimization is enabled, <code><nobr>mov r64,imm</nobr></code> now
optimizes to the shortest form possible between:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     mov r32,imm32                   ;  5 bytes 
     mov r64,imm32                   ;  7 bytes 
     mov r64,imm64                   ; 10 bytes
</pre>
<p>To force a specific form, use the <code><nobr>STRICT</nobr></code>
keyword, see <a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>.
<ul>
<li>Add support for the Intel AVX2 instruction set.
<li>Add support for Bit Manipulation Instructions 1 and 2.
<li>Add support for Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX).
<li>Add support for x32 ELF (32-bit ELF with the CPU in 64-bit mode.) See
<a href="nasmdoc7.html#section-7.10">section 7.10</a>.
<li>Add support for bigendian UTF-16 and UTF-32. See
<a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.4.5">section 3.4.5</a>.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.7">C.1.7 Version 2.09.10</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix up NSIS script to protect uninstaller against registry keys absence
or corruption. It brings in a few additional questions to a user during
deinstallation procedure but still it is better than unpredictable file
removal.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.8">C.1.8 Version 2.09.09</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix initialization of section attributes of
<code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> output format.
<li>Fix <code><nobr>mach64</nobr></code> output format bug that crashes
NASM due to NULL symbols.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.9">C.1.9 Version 2.09.08</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix <code><nobr>__OUTPUT_FORMAT__</nobr></code> assignment when output
driver alias is used. For example when <code><nobr>-f elf</nobr></code> is
used <code><nobr>__OUTPUT_FORMAT__</nobr></code> must be set to
<code><nobr>elf</nobr></code>, if <code><nobr>-f elf32</nobr></code> is
used <code><nobr>__OUTPUT_FORMAT__</nobr></code> must be assigned
accordingly, i.e. to <code><nobr>elf32</nobr></code>. The rule applies to
all output driver aliases. See
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.12.6">section 4.12.6</a>.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.10">C.1.10 Version 2.09.07</a></h4>

<li>Fix missed section attribute initialization in
<code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> output target.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.12">C.1.12 Version 2.09.05</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix arguments encoding for VPEXTRW instruction.
<li>Remove invalid form of VPEXTRW instruction.
<li>Add <code><nobr>VLDDQU</nobr></code> as alias for
<code><nobr>VLDQQU</nobr></code> to match specification.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix incorrect labels offset for VEX intructions.
<li>Eliminate bogus warning on implicit operand size override.
<li><code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> term could not handle 64 bit numbers.
<li>The COFF backend was limiting relocations number to 16 bits even if in
real there were a way more relocations.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.1.14">C.1.14 Version 2.09.03</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Print <code><nobr>%macro</nobr></code> name inside
<code><nobr>%rep</nobr></code> blocks on error.
<li>Fix preprocessor expansion behaviour. It happened sometime too early
and sometime simply wrong. Move behaviour back to the origins (down to NASM
2.05.01).
<li>Fix unitialized data dereference on OMF output format.
<li>Issue warning on unterminated <code><nobr>%{</nobr></code> construct.

more than one output token.
<li>Fix segmentation fault on disassembling some VEX instructions.
<li>Missing <code><nobr>%endif</nobr></code> did not always cause error.
<li>Fix typo in documentation.
<li>Compound context local preprocessor single line macro identifiers were
not expanded early enough and as result lead to unresolved symbols.
</ul>

<h4><a name="section-C.2.33">C.2.33 Version 0.98.09b with John Coffman patches released 28-Oct-2001</a></h4>
<p>Changes from 0.98.07 release to 98.09b as of 28-Oct-2001
<ul>
<li>More closely compatible with 0.98 when -O0 is implied or specified. Not
strictly identical, since backward branches in range of short offsets are
recognized, and signed byte values with no explicit size specification will
be assembled as a single byte.
<li>More forgiving with the PUSH instruction. 0.98 requires a size to be
specified always. 0.98.09b will imply the size from the current BITS
setting (16 or 32).
<li>Changed definition of the optimization flag:
</ul>
<p>-O0 strict two-pass assembly, JMP and Jcc are handled more like 0.98,
except that back- ward JMPs are short, if possible.
<p>-O1 strict two-pass assembly, but forward branches are assembled with
code guaranteed to reach; may produce larger code than -O0, but will
produce successful assembly more often if branch offset sizes are not
specified.
<p>-O2 multi-pass optimization, minimize branch offsets; also will minimize
signed immed- iate bytes, overriding size specification.
<p>-O3 like -O2, but more passes taken, if needed

<li>FIXME: Someone, fill this in with details
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.38">C.2.38 Version 0.98bf (bug-fixed)</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed - elf and aoutb bug - shared libraries - multiple "%include" bug
in "-f obj" - jcxz, jecxz bug - unrecognized option bug in ndisasm
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.39">C.2.39 Version 0.98.03 with John Coffman's changes released 27-Jul-2000</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Added signed byte optimizations for the 0x81/0x83 class of
instructions: ADC, ADD, AND, CMP, OR, SBB, SUB, XOR: when used as 'ADD
reg16,imm' or 'ADD reg32,imm.' Also optimization of signed byte form of
'PUSH imm' and 'IMUL reg,imm'/'IMUL reg,reg,imm.' No size specification is
needed.
<li>Added multi-pass JMP and Jcc offset optimization. Offsets on forward
references will preferentially use the short form, without the need to code
a specific size (short or near) for the branch. Added instructions for 'Jcc
label' to use the form 'Jnotcc $+3/JMP label', in cases where a short
offset is out of bounds. If compiling for a 386 or higher CPU, then the 386
form of Jcc will be used instead.
</ul>
<p>This feature is controlled by a new command-line switch: "O", (upper
case letter O). "-O0" reverts the assembler to no extra optimization
passes, "-O1" allows up to 5 extra passes, and "-O2"(default), allows up to
10 extra optimization passes.
<ul>
<li>Added a new directive: 'cpu XXX', where XXX is any of: 8086, 186, 286,
386, 486, 586, pentium, 686, PPro, P2, P3 or Katmai. All are case
insensitive. All instructions will be selected only if they apply to the
selected cpu or lower. Corrected a couple of bugs in cpu-dependence in
'insns.dat'.
<li>Added to 'standard.mac', the "use16" and "use32" forms of the "bits
16/32" directive. This is nothing new, just conforms to a lot of other
assemblers. (minor)
<li>Changed label allocation from 320/32 (10000 labels @ 200K+) to 32/37
(1000 labels); makes running under DOS much easier. Since additional label
space is allocated dynamically, this should have no effect on large
programs with lots of labels. The 37 is a prime, believed to be better for
hashing. (minor)
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.40">C.2.40 Version 0.98.03</a></h4>
<p>"Integrated patchfile 0.98-0.98.01. I call this version 0.98.03 for
historical reasons: 0.98.02 was trashed." --John Coffman
&lt;johninsd@san.rr.com&gt;, 27-Jul-2000
<ul>
<li>Kendall Bennett's SciTech MGL changes
<li>Note that you must define "TASM_COMPAT" at compile-time to get the Tasm
Ideal Mode compatibility.
<li>All changes can be compiled in and out using the TASM_COMPAT macros,
and when compiled without TASM_COMPAT defined we get the exact same binary
as the unmodified 0.98 sources.
<li>standard.mac, macros.c: Added macros to ignore TASM directives before
first include
<li>nasm.h: Added extern declaration for tasm_compatible_mode
<li>nasm.c: Added global variable tasm_compatible_mode
<li>Added command line switch for TASM compatible mode (-t)
<li>Changed version command line to reflect when compiled with TASM
additions
<li>Added response file processing to allow all arguments on a single line
(response file is @resp rather than -@resp for NASM format).
<li>labels.c: Changes islocal() macro to support TASM style @@local labels.
<li>Added islocalchar() macro to support TASM style @@local labels.
<li>parser.c: Added support for TASM style memory references (ie: mov
[DWORD eax],10 rather than the NASM style mov DWORD [eax],10).
<li>preproc.c: Added new directives, <code><nobr>%arg</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>%local</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>%stacksize</nobr></code> to
directives table
<li>Added support for TASM style directives without a leading % symbol.
<li>Integrated a block of changes from Andrew Zabolotny
&lt;bit@eltech.ru&gt;:
<li>A new keyword <code><nobr>%xdefine</nobr></code> and its
case-insensitive counterpart <code><nobr>%ixdefine</nobr></code>. They work
almost the same way as <code><nobr>%define</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>%idefine</nobr></code> but expand the definition immediately,
not on the invocation. Something like a cross between
<code><nobr>%define</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>%assign</nobr></code>.
The "x" suffix stands for "eXpand", so "xdefine" can be deciphered as
"expand-and-define". Thus you can do things like this:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     %assign ofs     0 

     %macro  arg     1 
             %xdefine %1 dword [esp+ofs] 
             %assign ofs ofs+4 
     %endmacro
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Changed the place where the expansion of %$name macros are expanded.
Now they are converted into ..@ctxnum.name form when detokenizing, so there
are no quirks as before when using %$name arguments to macros, in macros
etc. For example:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     %macro  abc     1 
             %define %1 hello 
     %endm 

     abc     %$here 
     %$here
</pre>
<p>Now last line will be expanded into "hello" as expected. This also
allows for lots of goodies, a good example are extended "proc" macros
included in this archive.
<ul>
<li>Added a check for "cstk" in smacro_defined() before calling get_ctx() -
this allows for things like:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     %ifdef %$abc 
     %endif
</pre>
<p>to work without warnings even in no context.
<ul>
<li>Added a check for "cstk" in %if*ctx and %elif*ctx directives - this
allows to use <code><nobr>%ifctx</nobr></code> without excessive warnings.
If there is no active context, <code><nobr>%ifctx</nobr></code> goes
through "false" branch.
<li>Removed "user error: " prefix with <code><nobr>%error</nobr></code>
directive: it just clobbers the output and has absolutely no functionality.
Besides, this allows to write macros that does not differ from built-in
functions in any way.
<li>Added expansion of string that is output by
<code><nobr>%error</nobr></code> directive. Now you can do things like:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     %define hello(x) Hello, x! 

     %define %$name andy 
     %error "hello(%$name)"
</pre>
<p>Same happened with <code><nobr>%include</nobr></code> directive.
<ul>
<li>Now all directives that expect an identifier will try to expand and
concatenate everything without whitespaces in between before usage. For
example, with "unfixed" nasm the commands
</ul>
<p><pre>
     %define %$abc hello 
     %define __%$abc goodbye 
     __%$abc
</pre>
<p>would produce "incorrect" output: last line will expand to
<p><pre>
     hello goodbyehello
</pre>
<p>Not quite what you expected, eh? :-) The answer is that preprocessor
treats the <code><nobr>%define</nobr></code> construct as if it would be
<p><pre>
     %define __ %$abc goodbye
</pre>
<p>(note the white space between __ and %$abc). After my "fix" it will
"correctly" expand into
<p><pre>
     goodbye
</pre>
<p>as expected. Note that I use quotes around words "correct", "incorrect"
etc because this is rather a feature not a bug; however current behaviour
is more logical (and allows more advanced macro usage :-).
<p>Same change was applied to:
<code><nobr>%push</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%macro</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%imacro</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%define</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%idefine</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%xdefine</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%ixdefine</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>%assign</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%iassign</nobr></code>,<code><nobr>%undef</nobr></code>
<ul>
<li>A new directive [WARNING {+|-}warning-id] have been added. It works
only if the assembly phase is enabled (i.e. it doesn't work with nasm -e).
<li>A new warning type: macro-selfref. By default this warning is disabled;
when enabled NASM warns when a macro self-references itself; for example
the following source:
</ul>
<p><pre>
       [WARNING macro-selfref] 

       %macro          push    1-* 
               %rep    %0 
                       push    %1 
                       %rotate 1 
               %endrep 
       %endmacro 

                       push    eax,ebx,ecx
</pre>
<p>will produce a warning, but if we remove the first line we won't see it
anymore (which is The Right Thing To Do {tm} IMHO since C preprocessor eats
such constructs without warnings at all).
<ul>
<li>Added a "error" routine to preprocessor which always will set ERR_PASS1
bit in severity_code. This removes annoying repeated errors on first and
second passes from preprocessor.
<li>Added the %+ operator in single-line macros for concatenating two
identifiers. Usage example:
</ul>
<p><pre>
       %define _myfunc _otherfunc 
       %define cextern(x) _ %+ x 
       cextern (myfunc)
</pre>
<p>After first expansion, third line will become "_myfunc". After this
expansion is performed again so it becomes "_otherunc".
<ul>
<li>Now if preprocessor is in a non-emitting state, no warning or error
will be emitted. Example:
</ul>
<p><pre>
       %if 1 
               mov     eax,ebx 
       %else 
               put anything you want between these two brackets, 
               even macro-parameter references %1 or local 
               labels %$zz or macro-local labels %%zz - no 
               warning will be emitted. 
       %endif
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Context-local variables on expansion as a last resort are looked up in
outer contexts. For example, the following piece:
</ul>
<p><pre>
       %push   outer 
       %define %$a [esp] 

               %push   inner 
               %$a 
               %pop 
       %pop
</pre>
<p>will expand correctly the fourth line to [esp]; if we'll define another
%$a inside the "inner" context, it will take precedence over outer
definition. However, this modification has been applied only to
expand_smacro and not to smacro_define: as a consequence expansion looks in
outer contexts, but <code><nobr>%ifdef</nobr></code> won't look in outer
contexts.
<p>This behaviour is needed because we don't want nested contexts to act on
already defined local macros. Example:
<p><pre>
       %define %$arg1  [esp+4] 
       test    eax,eax 
       if      nz 
               mov     eax,%$arg1 
       endif
</pre>
<p>In this example the "if" mmacro enters into the "if" context, so %$arg1
is not valid anymore inside "if". Of course it could be worked around by
using explicitely %$$arg1 but this is ugly IMHO.
<ul>
<li>Fixed memory leak in <code><nobr>%undef</nobr></code>. The origline
wasn't freed before exiting on success.
<li>Fixed trap in preprocessor when line expanded to empty set of tokens.
This happens, for example, in the following case:
</ul>
<p><pre>
       #define SOMETHING 
       SOMETHING
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.41">C.2.41 Version 0.98</a></h4>
<p>All changes since NASM 0.98p3 have been produced by H. Peter Anvin
&lt;hpa@zytor.com&gt;.
<ul>
<li>The documentation comment delimiter is
<li>Allow EQU definitions to refer to external labels; reported by Pedro
Gimeno.
<li>Re-enable support for RDOFF v1; reported by Pedro Gimeno.
<li>Updated License file per OK from Simon and Julian.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.42">C.2.42 Version 0.98p9</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Update documentation (although the instruction set reference will have
to wait; I don't want to hold up the 0.98 release for it.)
<li>Verified that the NASM implementation of the PEXTRW and PMOVMSKB
instructions is correct. The encoding differs from what the Intel manuals
document, but the Pentium III behaviour matches NASM, not the Intel
manuals.
<li>Fix handling of implicit sizes in PSHUFW and PINSRW, reported by Stefan
Hoffmeister.
<li>Resurrect the -s option, which was removed when changing the diagnostic
output to stdout.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.43">C.2.43 Version 0.98p8</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix for "DB" when NASM is running on a bigendian machine.
<li>Invoke insns.pl once for each output script, making Makefile.in legal
for "make -j".
<li>Improve the Unix configure-based makefiles to make package creation
easier.
<li>Included an RPM .spec file for building RPM (RedHat Package Manager)
packages on Linux or Unix systems.
<li>Fix Makefile dependency problems.
<li>Change src/rdsrc.pl to include sectioning information in info output;
required for install-info to work.
<li>Updated the RDOFF distribution to version 2 from Jules; minor massaging
to make it compile in my environment.
<li>Split doc files that can be built by anyone with a Perl interpreter off
into a separate archive.
<li>"Dress rehearsal" release!
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.44">C.2.44 Version 0.98p7</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed opcodes with a third byte-sized immediate argument to not
complain if given "byte" on the immediate.
<li>Allow <code><nobr>%undef</nobr></code> to remove single-line macros
with arguments. This matches the behaviour of #undef in the C preprocessor.
<li>Allow -d, -u, -i and -p to be specified as -D, -U, -I and -P for
compatibility with most C compilers and preprocessors. This allows Makefile
options to be shared between cc and nasm, for example.
<li>Minor cleanups.
<li>Went through the list of Katmai instructions and hopefully fixed the
(rather few) mistakes in it.
<li>(Hopefully) fixed a number of disassembler bugs related to ambiguous
instructions (disambiguated by -p) and SSE instructions with REP.
<li>Fix for bug reported by Mark Junger: "call dword 0x12345678" should
work and may add an OSP (affected CALL, JMP, Jcc).
<li>Fix for environments when "stderr" isn't a compile-time constant.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.45">C.2.45 Version 0.98p6</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Took officially over coordination of the 0.98 release; so drop the p3.x
notation. Skipped p4 and p5 to avoid confusion with John Fine's J4 and J5
releases.
<li>Update the documentation; however, it still doesn't include
documentation for the various new instructions. I somehow wonder if it
makes sense to have an instruction set reference in the assembler manual
when Intel et al have PDF versions of their manuals online.
<li>Recognize "idt" or "centaur" for the -p option to ndisasm.
<li>Changed error messages back to stderr where they belong, but add an -E
option to redirect them elsewhere (the DOS shell cannot redirect stderr.)
<li>-M option to generate Makefile dependencies (based on code from Alex
Verstak.)
<li><code><nobr>%undef</nobr></code> preprocessor directive, and -u option,
that undefines a single-line macro.
<li>OS/2 Makefile (Mkfiles/Makefile.os2) for Borland under OS/2; from Chuck
Crayne.
<li>Various minor bugfixes (reported by): - Dangling
<code><nobr>%s</nobr></code> in preproc.c (Martin Junker)
<li>THERE ARE KNOWN BUGS IN SSE AND THE OTHER KATMAI INSTRUCTIONS. I am on
a trip and didn't bring the Katmai instruction reference, so I can't work
on them right now.
<li>Updated the License file per agreement with Simon and Jules to include
a GPL distribution clause.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.46">C.2.46 Version 0.98p3.7</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>(Hopefully) fixed the canned Makefiles to include the outrdf2 and
zoutieee modules.
<li>Renamed changes.asm to changed.asm.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.47">C.2.47 Version 0.98p3.6</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bunch of instructions that were added in 0.98p3.5 which had
memory operands, and the address-size prefix was missing from the
instruction pattern.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.48">C.2.48 Version 0.98p3.5</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Merged in changes from John S. Fine's 0.98-J5 release. John's based
0.98-J5 on my 0.98p3.3 release; this merges the changes.
<li>Expanded the instructions flag field to a long so we can fit more
flags; mark SSE (KNI) and AMD or Katmai-specific instructions as such.
<li>Fix the "PRIV" flag on a bunch of instructions, and create new "PROT"
flag for protected-mode-only instructions (orthogonal to if the instruction
is privileged!) and new "SMM" flag for SMM-only instructions.
<li>Added AMD-only SYSCALL and SYSRET instructions.
<li>Make SSE actually work, and add new Katmai MMX instructions.
<li>Added a -p (preferred vendor) option to ndisasm so that it can
distinguish e.g. Cyrix opcodes also used in SSE. For example:
</ul>
<p><pre>
     ndisasm -p cyrix aliased.bin 
     00000000  670F514310        paddsiw mm0,[ebx+0x10] 
     00000005  670F514320        paddsiw mm0,[ebx+0x20] 
     ndisasm -p intel aliased.bin 
     00000000  670F514310        sqrtps xmm0,[ebx+0x10] 
     00000005  670F514320        sqrtps xmm0,[ebx+0x20]
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Added a bunch of Cyrix-specific instructions.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.49">C.2.49 Version 0.98p3.4</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Made at least an attempt to modify all the additional Makefiles (in the
Mkfiles directory). I can't test it, but this was the best I could do.
<li>DOS DJGPP+"Opus Make" Makefile from John S. Fine.
<li>changes.asm changes from John S. Fine.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.50">C.2.50 Version 0.98p3.3</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch from Conan Brink to allow nesting of
<code><nobr>%rep</nobr></code> directives.
<li>If we're going to allow INT01 as an alias for INT1/ICEBP (one of Jules
0.98p3 changes), then we should allow INT03 as an alias for INT3 as well.
<li>Updated changes.asm to include the latest changes.
<li>Tried to clean up the &lt;CR&gt;s that had snuck in from a DOS/Windows
environment into my Unix environment, and try to make sure than DOS/Windows
users get them back.
<li>We would silently generate broken tools if insns.dat wasn't sorted
properly. Change insns.pl so that the order doesn't matter.
<li>Fix bug in insns.pl (introduced by me) which would cause conditional
instructions to have an extra "cc" in disassembly, e.g. "jnz" disassembled
as "jccnz".
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.51">C.2.51 Version 0.98p3.2</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Merged in John S. Fine's changes from his 0.98-J4 prerelease; see
http://www.csoft.net/cz/johnfine/
<li>Changed previous "spotless" Makefile target (appropriate for
distribution) to "distclean", and added "cleaner" target which is same as
"clean" except deletes files generated by Perl scripts; "spotless" is
union.
<li>Removed BASIC programs from distribution. Get a Perl interpreter
instead (see below.)
<li>Calling this "pre-release 3.2" rather than "p3-hpa2" because of John's
contributions.
<li>Actually link in the IEEE output format (zoutieee.c); fix a bunch of
compiler warnings in that file. Note I don't know what IEEE output is
supposed to look like, so these changes were made "blind".
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.52">C.2.52 Version 0.98p3-hpa</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Merged nasm098p3.zip with nasm-0.97.tar.gz to create a fully buildable
version for Unix systems (Makefile.in updates, etc.)
<li>Changed insns.pl to create the instruction tables in nasm.h and
names.c, so that a new instruction can be added by adding it *only* to
insns.dat.
<li>Added the following new instructions: SYSENTER, SYSEXIT, FXSAVE,
FXRSTOR, UD1, UD2 (the latter two are two opcodes that Intel guarantee will
never be used; one of them is documented as UD2 in Intel documentation, the
other one just as "Undefined Opcode" -- calling it UD1 seemed to make
sense.)
<li>MAX_SYMBOL was defined to be 9, but LOADALL286 and LOADALL386 are 10
characters long. Now MAX_SYMBOL is derived from insns.dat.
<li>A note on the BASIC programs included: forget them. insns.bas is
already out of date. Get yourself a Perl interpreter for your platform of
choice at
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html">http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html</a>.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.53">C.2.53 Version 0.98 pre-release 3</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>added response file support, improved command line handling, new layout
help screen
<li>fixed limit checking bug, 'OUT byte nn, reg' bug, and a couple of rdoff
related bugs, updated Wishlist; 0.98 Prerelease 3.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.54">C.2.54 Version 0.98 pre-release 2</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in outcoff.c to do with truncating section names longer than
8 characters, referencing beyond end of string; 0.98 pre-release 2
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.2.55">C.2.55 Version 0.98 pre-release 1</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug whereby STRUC didn't work at all in RDF.
<li>Fixed a problem with group specification in PUBDEFs in OBJ.
<li>Improved ease of adding new output formats. Contribution due to Fox
Cutter.
<li>Fixed a bug in relocations in the `bin' format: was showing up when a
relocatable reference crossed an 8192-byte boundary in any output section.
<li>Fixed a bug in local labels: local-label lookups were inconsistent
between passes one and two if an EQU occurred between the definition of a
global label and the subsequent use of a local label local to that global.
<li>Fixed a seg-fault in the preprocessor (again) which happened when you
use a blank line as the first line of a multi-line macro definition and
then defined a label on the same line as a call to that macro.
<li>Fixed a stale-pointer bug in the handling of the NASM environment
variable. Thanks to Thomas McWilliams.
<li>ELF had a hard limit on the number of sections which caused segfaults
when transgressed. Fixed.
<li>Added ability for ndisasm to read from stdin by using `-' as the
filename.
<li>ndisasm wasn't outputting the TO keyword. Fixed.
<li>Fixed error cascade on bogus expression in
<code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> - an error in evaluation was causing the
entire <code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> to be discarded, thus creating trouble
later when the <code><nobr>%else</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>%endif</nobr></code> was encountered.
<li>Forward reference tracking was instruction-granular not operand-
granular, which was causing 286-specific code to be generated needlessly on
code of the form `shr word [forwardref],1'. Thanks to Jim Hague for sending
a patch.
<li>All messages now appear on stdout, as sending them to stderr serves no
useful purpose other than to make redirection difficult.
<li>Fixed the problem with EQUs pointing to an external symbol - this now
generates an error message.
<li>Allowed multiple size prefixes to an operand, of which only the first
is taken into account.
<li>Incorporated John Fine's changes, including fixes of a large number of
preprocessor bugs, some small problems in OBJ, and a reworking of label
handling to define labels before their line is assembled, rather than
after.
<li>Reformatted a lot of the source code to be more readable. Included
'coding.txt' as a guideline for how to format code for contributors.
<li>Stopped nested <code><nobr>%reps</nobr></code> causing a panic - they
now cause a slightly more friendly error message instead.
<li>Fixed floating point constant problems (patch by Pedro Gimeno)
<li>Fixed the return value of insn_size() not being checked for -1,
indicating an error.
<li>Incorporated 3Dnow! instructions.
<li>Fixed the 'mov eax, eax + ebx' bug.
<li>Fixed the GLOBAL EQU bug in ELF. Released developers release 3.
<li>Incorporated John Fine's command line parsing changes
<li>Incorporated David Lindauer's OMF debug support
<li>Made changes for LCC 4.0 support
(<code><nobr>__NASM_CDecl__</nobr></code>, removed register size
specification warning when sizes agree).
</ul>
<h3><a name="section-C.3">C.3 NASM 0.9 Series</a></h3>
<p>Revisions before 0.98.
<h4><a name="section-C.3.1">C.3.1 Version 0.97 released December 1997</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>This was entirely a bug-fix release to 0.96, which seems to have got
cursed. Silly me.
<li>Fixed stupid mistake in OBJ which caused `MOV EAX,&lt;constant&gt;' to
fail. Caused by an error in the `MOV EAX,&lt;segment&gt;' support.
<li>ndisasm hung at EOF when compiled with lcc on Linux because lcc on
Linux somehow breaks feof(). ndisasm now does not rely on feof().
<li>A heading in the documentation was missing due to a markup error in the
indexing. Fixed.
<li>Fixed failure to update all pointers on realloc() within extended-
operand code in parser.c. Was causing wrong behaviour and seg faults on
lines such as `dd 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,...'
<li>Fixed a subtle preprocessor bug whereby invoking one multi-line macro
on the first line of the expansion of another, when the second had been
invoked with a label defined before it, didn't expand the inner macro.
<li>Added internal.doc back in to the distribution archives - it was
missing in 0.96 *blush*
<li>Fixed bug causing 0.96 to be unable to assemble its own test files,
specifically objtest.asm. *blush again*
<li>Fixed seg-faults and bogus error messages caused by mismatching
<code><nobr>%rep</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>%endrep</nobr></code> within
multi-line macro definitions.
<li>Fixed a problem with buffer overrun in OBJ, which was causing
corruption at ends of long PUBDEF records.
<li>Separated DOS archives into main-program and documentation to reduce
download size.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.2">C.3.2 Version 0.96 released November 1997</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug whereby, if `nasm sourcefile' would cause a filename
collision warning and put output into `nasm.out', then `nasm sourcefile -o
outputfile' still gave the warning even though the `-o' was honoured. Fixed
name pollution under Digital UNIX: one of its header files defined R_SP,
which broke the enum in nasm.h.
<li>Fixed minor instruction table problems: FUCOM and FUCOMP didn't have
two-operand forms; NDISASM didn't recognise the longer register forms of
PUSH and POP (eg FF F3 for PUSH BX); TEST mem,imm32 was flagged as
undocumented; the 32-bit forms of CMOV had 16-bit operand size prefixes;
`AAD imm' and `AAM imm' are no longer flagged as undocumented because the
Intel Architecture reference documents them.
<li>Fixed a problem with the local-label mechanism, whereby strange types
of symbol (EQUs, auto-defined OBJ segment base symbols) interfered with the
`previous global label' value and screwed up local labels.
<li>Fixed a bug whereby the stub preprocessor didn't communicate with the
listing file generator, so that the -a and -l options in conjunction would
produce a useless listing file.
<li>Merged `os2' object file format back into `obj', after discovering that
`obj' _also_ shouldn't have a link pass separator in a module containing a
non-trivial MODEND. Flat segments are now declared using the FLAT
attribute. `os2' is no longer a valid object format name: use `obj'.
<li>Removed the fixed-size temporary storage in the evaluator. Very very
long expressions (like `mov ax,1+1+1+1+...' for two hundred 1s or so)
should now no longer crash NASM.
<li>Fixed a bug involving segfaults on disassembly of MMX instructions, by
changing the meaning of one of the operand-type flags in nasm.h. This may
cause other apparently unrelated MMX problems; it needs to be tested
thoroughly.
<li>Fixed some buffer overrun problems with large OBJ output files. Thanks
to DJ Delorie for the bug report and fix.
<li>Made preprocess-only mode actually listen to the
<code><nobr>%line</nobr></code> markers as it prints them, so that it can
report errors more sanely.
<li>Re-designed the evaluator to keep more sensible track of expressions
involving forward references: can now cope with previously-nightmare
situations such as:
</ul>
<p><pre>
  mov ax,foo | bar 
  foo equ 1 
  bar equ 2
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Added the ALIGN and ALIGNB standard macros.
<li>Added PIC support in ELF: use of WRT to obtain the four extra
relocation types needed.
<li>Added the ability for output file formats to define their own
extensions to the GLOBAL, COMMON and EXTERN directives.
<li>Implemented common-variable alignment, and global-symbol type and size
declarations, in ELF.
<li>Implemented NEAR and FAR keywords for common variables, plus far-common
element size specification, in OBJ.
<li>Added a feature whereby EXTERNs and COMMONs in OBJ can be given a
default WRT specification (either a segment or a group).
<li>Transformed the Unix NASM archive into an auto-configuring package.
<li>Added a sanity-check for people applying SEG to things which are
already segment bases: this previously went unnoticed by the SEG processing
and caused OBJ-driver panics later.
<li>Added the ability, in OBJ format, to deal with `MOV
EAX,&lt;segment&gt;' type references: OBJ doesn't directly support
dword-size segment base fixups, but as long as the low two bytes of the
constant term are zero, a word-size fixup can be generated instead and it
will work.
<li>Added the ability to specify sections' alignment requirements in Win32
object files and pure binary files.
<li>Added preprocess-time expression evaluation: the
<code><nobr>%assign</nobr></code> (and <code><nobr>%iassign</nobr></code>)
directive and the bare <code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> (and
<code><nobr>%elif</nobr></code>) conditional. Added relational operators to
the evaluator, for use only in <code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> constructs:
the standard relationals = &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= &lt;&gt; (and C-like
synonyms == and !=) plus low-precedence logical operators &amp;&amp;, ^^
and ||.
<li>Added a preprocessor repeat construct: <code><nobr>%rep</nobr></code> /
<code><nobr>%exitrep</nobr></code> / <code><nobr>%endrep</nobr></code>.
<li>Added the __FILE__ and __LINE__ standard macros.
<li>Added a sanity check for number constants being greater than
0xFFFFFFFF. The warning can be disabled.
<li>Added the %0 token whereby a variadic multi-line macro can tell how
many parameters it's been given in a specific invocation.
<li>Added <code><nobr>%rotate</nobr></code>, allowing multi-line macro
parameters to be cycled.
<li>Added the `*' option for the maximum parameter count on multi-line
macros, allowing them to take arbitrarily many parameters.
<li>Added the ability for the user-level forms of EXTERN, GLOBAL and COMMON
to take more than one argument.
<li>Added the IMPORT and EXPORT directives in OBJ format, to deal with
Windows DLLs.
<li>Added some more preprocessor <code><nobr>%if</nobr></code> constructs:
<code><nobr>%ifidn</nobr></code> / <code><nobr>%ifidni</nobr></code> (exact
textual identity), and <code><nobr>%ifid</nobr></code> /
<code><nobr>%ifnum</nobr></code> / <code><nobr>%ifstr</nobr></code> (token
type testing).
<li>Added the ability to distinguish SHL AX,1 (the 8086 version) from SHL
AX,BYTE 1 (the 286-and-upwards version whose constant happens to be 1).
<li>Added NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD's variant of a.out format, complete with
PIC shared library features.
<li>Changed NASM's idiosyncratic handling of FCLEX, FDISI, FENI, FINIT,
FSAVE, FSTCW, FSTENV, and FSTSW to bring it into line with the otherwise
accepted standard. The previous behaviour, though it was a deliberate
feature, was a deliberate feature based on a misunderstanding. Apologies
for the inconvenience.
<li>Improved the flexibility of ABSOLUTE: you can now give it an expression
rather than being restricted to a constant, and it can take relocatable
arguments as well.
<li>Added the ability for a variable to be declared as EXTERN multiple
times, and the subsequent definitions are just ignored.
<li>We now allow instruction prefixes (CS, DS, LOCK, REPZ etc) to be alone
on a line (without a following instruction).
<li>Improved sanity checks on whether the arguments to EXTERN, GLOBAL and
COMMON are valid identifiers.
<li>Added misc/exebin.mac to allow direct generation of .EXE files by
hacking up an EXE header using DB and DW; also added test/binexe.asm to
demonstrate the use of this. Thanks to Yann Guidon for contributing the EXE
header code.
<li>ndisasm forgot to check whether the input file had been successfully
opened. Now it does. Doh!
<li>Added the Cyrix extensions to the MMX instruction set.
<li>Added a hinting mechanism to allow [EAX+EBX] and [EBX+EAX] to be
assembled differently. This is important since [ESI+EBP] and [EBP+ESI] have
different default base segment registers.
<li>Added support for the PharLap OMF extension for 4096-byte segment
alignment.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.3">C.3.3 Version 0.95 released July 1997</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed yet another ELF bug. This one manifested if the user relied on
the default segment, and attempted to define global symbols without first
explicitly declaring the target segment.
<li>Added makefiles (for NASM and the RDF tools) to build Win32 console
apps under Symantec C++. Donated by Mark Junker.
<li>Added `macros.bas' and `insns.bas', QBasic versions of the Perl scripts
that convert `standard.mac' to `macros.c' and convert `insns.dat' to
`insnsa.c' and `insnsd.c'. Also thanks to Mark Junker.
<li>Changed the diassembled forms of the conditional instructions so that
JB is now emitted as JC, and other similar changes. Suggested list by
Ulrich Doewich.
<li>Added `@' to the list of valid characters to begin an identifier with.
<li>Documentary changes, notably the addition of the `Common Problems'
section in nasm.doc.
<li>Fixed a bug relating to 32-bit PC-relative fixups in OBJ.
<li>Fixed a bug in perm_copy() in labels.c which was causing exceptions in
cleanup_labels() on some systems.
<li>Positivity sanity check in TIMES argument changed from a warning to an
error following a further complaint.
<li>Changed the acceptable limits on byte and word operands to allow things
like `~10111001b' to work.
<li>Fixed a major problem in the preprocessor which caused seg-faults if
macro definitions contained blank lines or comment-only lines.
<li>Fixed inadequate error checking on the commas separating the arguments
to `db', `dw' etc.
<li>Fixed a crippling bug in the handling of macros with operand counts
defined with a `+' modifier.
<li>Fixed a bug whereby object file formats which stored the input file
name in the output file (such as OBJ and COFF) weren't doing so correctly
when the output file name was specified on the command line.
<li>Removed [INC] and [INCLUDE] support for good, since they were obsolete
anyway.
<li>Fixed a bug in OBJ which caused all fixups to be output in 16-bit
(old-format) FIXUPP records, rather than putting the 32-bit ones in
FIXUPP32 (new-format) records.
<li>Added, tentatively, OS/2 object file support (as a minor variant on
OBJ).
<li>Updates to Fox Cutter's Borland C makefile, Makefile.bc2.
<li>Removed a spurious second fclose() on the output file.
<li>Added the `-s' command line option to redirect all messages which would
go to stderr (errors, help text) to stdout instead.
<li>Added the `-w' command line option to selectively suppress some classes
of assembly warning messages.
<li>Added the `-p' pre-include and `-d' pre-define command-line options.
<li>Added an include file search path: the `-i' command line option.
<li>Fixed a silly little preprocessor bug whereby starting a line with a
`%!' environment-variable reference caused an `unknown directive' error.
<li>Added the long-awaited listing file support: the `-l' command line
option.
<li>Fixed a problem with OBJ format whereby, in the absence of any explicit
segment definition, non-global symbols declared in the implicit default
segment generated spurious EXTDEF records in the output.
<li>Added the NASM environment variable.
<li>From this version forward, Win32 console-mode binaries will be included
in the DOS distribution in addition to the 16-bit binaries. Added
Makefile.vc for this purpose.
<li>Added `return 0;' to test/objlink.c to prevent compiler warnings.
<li>Added the __NASM_MAJOR__ and __NASM_MINOR__ standard defines.
<li>Added an alternative memory-reference syntax in which prefixing an
operand with `&amp;' is equivalent to enclosing it in square brackets, at
the request of Fox Cutter.
<li>Errors in pass two now cause the program to return a non-zero error
code, which they didn't before.
<li>Fixed the single-line macro cycle detection, which didn't work at all
on macros with no parameters (caused an infinite loop). Also changed the
behaviour of single-line macro cycle detection to work like cpp, so that
macros like `extrn' as given in the documentation can be implemented.
<li>Fixed the implementation of WRT, which was too restrictive in that you
couldn't do `mov ax,[di+abc wrt dgroup]' because (di+abc) wasn't a
relocatable reference.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.4">C.3.4 Version 0.94 released April 1997</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Major item: added the macro processor.
<li>Added undocumented instructions SMI, IBTS, XBTS and LOADALL286. Also
reorganised CMPXCHG instruction into early-486 and Pentium forms. Thanks to
Thobias Jones for the information.
<li>Fixed two more stupid bugs in ELF, which were causing `ld' to continue
to seg-fault in a lot of non-trivial cases.
<li>Fixed a seg-fault in the label manager.
<li>Stopped FBLD and FBSTP from _requiring_ the TWORD keyword, which is the
only option for BCD loads/stores in any case.
<li>Ensured FLDCW, FSTCW and FSTSW can cope with the WORD keyword, if
anyone bothers to provide it. Previously they complained unless no keyword
at all was present.
<li>Some forms of FDIV/FDIVR and FSUB/FSUBR were still inverted: a vestige
of a bug that I thought had been fixed in 0.92. This was fixed, hopefully
for good this time...
<li>Another minor phase error (insofar as a phase error can _ever_ be
minor) fixed, this one occurring in code of the form
</ul>
<p><pre>
  rol ax,forward_reference 
  forward_reference equ 1
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The number supplied to TIMES is now sanity-checked for positivity, and
also may be greater than 64K (which previously didn't work on 16-bit
systems).
<li>Added Watcom C makefiles, and misc/pmw.bat, donated by Dominik Behr.
<li>Added the INCBIN pseudo-opcode.
<li>Due to the advent of the preprocessor, the [INCLUDE] and [INC]
directives have become obsolete. They are still supported in this version,
with a warning, but won't be in the next.
<li>Fixed a bug in OBJ format, which caused incorrect object records to be
output when absolute labels were made global.
<li>Updates to RDOFF subdirectory, and changes to outrdf.c.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.5">C.3.5 Version 0.93 released January 1997</a></h4>
<p>This release went out in a great hurry after semi-crippling bugs were
found in 0.92.
<ul>
<li>Really <em>did</em> fix the stack overflows this time. *blush*
<li>Had problems with EA instruction sizes changing between passes, when an
offset contained a forward reference and so 4 bytes were allocated for the
offset in pass one; by pass two the symbol had been defined and happened to
be a small absolute value, so only 1 byte got allocated, causing
instruction size mismatch between passes and hence incorrect address
calculations. Fixed.
<li>Stupid bug in the revised ELF section generation fixed (associated
string-table section for .symtab was hard-coded as 7, even when this didn't
fit with the real section table). Was causing `ld' to seg-fault under
Linux.
<li>Included a new Borland C makefile, Makefile.bc2, donated by Fox Cutter
&lt;lmb@comtch.iea.com&gt;.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.6">C.3.6 Version 0.92 released January 1997</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The FDIVP/FDIVRP and FSUBP/FSUBRP pairs had been inverted: this was
fixed. This also affected the LCC driver.
<li>Fixed a bug regarding 32-bit effective addresses of the form
<code><nobr>[other_register+ESP]</nobr></code>.
<li>Documentary changes, notably documentation of the fact that Borland
Win32 compilers use `obj' rather than `win32' object format.
<li>Fixed the COMENT record in OBJ files, which was formatted incorrectly.
<li>Fixed a bug causing segfaults in large RDF files.
<li>OBJ format now strips initial periods from segment and group
definitions, in order to avoid complications with the local label syntax.
<li>Fixed a bug in disassembling far calls and jumps in NDISASM.
<li>Added support for user-defined sections in COFF and ELF files.
<li>Compiled the DOS binaries with a sensible amount of stack, to prevent
stack overflows on any arithmetic expression containing parentheses.
<li>Fixed a bug in handling of files that do not terminate in a newline.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.7">C.3.7 Version 0.91 released November 1996</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Loads of bug fixes.
<li>Support for RDF added.
<li>Support for DBG debugging format added.
<li>Support for 32-bit extensions to Microsoft OBJ format added.
<li>Revised for Borland C: some variable names changed, makefile added.
<li>LCC support revised to actually work.
<li>JMP/CALL NEAR/FAR notation added.
<li>`a16', `o16', `a32' and `o32' prefixes added.
<li>Range checking on short jumps implemented.
<li>MMX instruction support added.
<li>Negative floating point constant support added.
<li>Memory handling improved to bypass 64K barrier under DOS.
<li><code><nobr>$</nobr></code> prefix to force treatment of reserved words
as identifiers added.
<li>Default-size mechanism for object formats added.
<li>Compile-time configurability added.
<li><code><nobr>#</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>@</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>~</nobr></code> and c{?} are now valid characters in labels.
<li><code><nobr>-e</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>-k</nobr></code> options
in NDISASM added.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-C.3.8">C.3.8 Version 0.90 released October 1996</a></h4>
<p>First release version. First support for object file output. Other
changes from previous version (0.3x) too numerous to document.
