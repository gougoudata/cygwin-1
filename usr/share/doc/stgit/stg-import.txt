NAME
----
stg-import - Import a GNU diff file as a new patch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' import [options] [--] [<file>|<url>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Create a new patch and apply the given GNU diff file (or the standard
input). By default, the file name is used as the patch name but this
can be overridden with the '--name' option. The patch can either be a
normal file with the description at the top or it can have standard
mail format, the Subject, From and Date headers being used for
generating the patch information. The command can also read series and
mbox files.

If a patch does not apply cleanly, the failed diff is written to the
.stgit-failed.patch file and an empty StGIT patch is added to the
stack.

The patch description has to be separated from the data with a '---'
line.
