For basic installation:

	$ make all doc ;# as yourself
	$ make install install-doc ;# as yourself

By default, the above command installs StGIT in the
$HOME/{bin,lib,share} directories. For a different location, use the
prefix option.

	$ make prefix=/usr all doc #; as yourself
	# make prefix=/usr install install-doc #; as root

Issues of note:

- StGit requires git version 1.6.1 or later. (Specifically, it needs a
  git that includes commit 140b378d: "Teach git diff-tree --stdin to
  diff trees".)

- To build and install the documentation, you need to have the
  asciidoc/xmlto toolchain.  The default build target ("make all")
  does _not_ build them.
