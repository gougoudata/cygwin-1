NAME
----
stg-pull - Pull changes from a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' pull [options] [--] [<repository>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Pull the latest changes from the given remote repository (defaulting
to branch.<name>.remote, or 'origin' if not set). This command works
by popping all the patches from the stack, pulling the changes in the
parent repository, setting the base of the stack to the latest parent
HEAD and pushing the patches back (unless '--nopush' is specified).
The 'push' operation can fail if there are conflicts. They need to be
resolved and the patch pushed again.

Check the 'git fetch' documentation for the <repository> format.

OPTIONS
-------
-n::
--nopush::
        Do not push the patches back after pulling.

-m::
--merged::
        Check for patches merged upstream.
