NAME
----
stg-refresh - Generate a new commit for the current patch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' refresh [options] [--] [<files or dirs>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Include the latest work tree and index changes in the current patch.
This command generates a new git commit object for the patch; the old
commit is no longer visible.

You may optionally list one or more files or directories relative to
the current working directory; if you do, only matching files will be
updated.

Behind the scenes, stg refresh first creates a new temporary patch
with your updates, and then merges that patch into the patch you asked
to have refreshed. If you asked to refresh a patch other than the
topmost patch, there can be conflicts; in that case, the temporary
patch will be left for you to take care of, for example with stg
squash.

The creation of the temporary patch is recorded in a separate entry in
the patch stack log; this means that one undo step will undo the merge
between the other patch and the temp patch, and two undo steps will
additionally get rid of the temp patch.
