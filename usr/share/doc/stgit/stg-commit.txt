stg-commit(1)
=============

NAME
----
stg-commit - Permanently store the applied patches into the stack base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' commit 
'stg' commit [--] <patchnames>
'stg' commit -n NUM
'stg' commit --all

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Merge one or more patches into the base of the current stack and
remove them from the series while advancing the base. This is the
opposite of 'stg uncommit'. Use this command if you no longer want to
manage a patch with StGIT.

By default, the bottommost patch is committed. If patch names are
given, the stack is rearranged so that those patches are at the
bottom, and then they are committed.

The -n/--number option specifies the number of applied patches to
commit (counting from the bottom of the stack). If -a/--all is given,
all applied patches are committed.

OPTIONS
-------
-n NUMBER::
--number NUMBER::
        Commit the specified number of patches.

-a::
--all::
        Commit all applied patches.
