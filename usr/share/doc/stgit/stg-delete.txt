=============

NAME
----
stg-delete - Delete patches

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' delete [options] [--] <patch1> [<patch2>] [<patch3>..<patch4>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Delete the patches passed as arguments.

OPTIONS
-------
--spill::
        Delete the patches, but do not touch the index and worktree.
        This only works with applied patches at the top of the stack.
        The effect is to "spill" the patch contents into the index and
        worktree. This can be useful e.g. if you want to split a patch
        into several smaller pieces.

-b BRANCH::
--branch BRANCH::
        Use BRANCH instead of the default branch.
