NAME
----
stg-pop - Pop one or more patches from the stack

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' pop [options] [--] [<patch1>] [<patch2>] [<patch3>..<patch4>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Pop the topmost patch or a range of patches from the stack. The
command fails if there are conflicts or local changes (and --keep was
not specified).

A series of pop and push operations are performed so that only the
patches passed on the command line are popped from the stack. Some of
the push operations may fail because of conflicts ("stg undo" would
revert the last push operation).

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
--all::
        Pop all the applied patches.

-n NUMBER::
--number NUMBER::
        Pop the specified number of patches.
+
With a negative number, pop all but that many patches.

-k::
--keep::
        Keep the local changes.
