NAME
----
stg-edit - Edit a patch description or diff

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' edit [options] [--] [<patch>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Edit the description and author information of the given patch (or the
current patch if no patch name was given). With --diff, also edit the
diff.

The editor is invoked with the following contents:

  From: A U Thor <author@example.com>
  Date: creation date

  Patch description

If --diff was specified, the diff appears at the bottom, after a
separator:

  ---

  Diff text

Command-line options can be used to modify specific information
without invoking the editor. (With the --edit option, the editor is
invoked even if such command-line options are given.)

If the patch diff is edited but does not apply, no changes are made to
the patch at all. The edited patch is saved to a file which you can
feed to "stg edit --file", once you have made sure it does apply.

With --set-tree you set the git tree of the patch to the specified
TREE-ISH without changing the tree of any other patches. When used on
the top patch, the index and work tree will be updated to match the
tree.  This low-level option is primarily meant to be used by tools
built on top of StGit, such as the Emacs mode. See also the --set-tree
flag of stg push.

OPTIONS
-------
-d::
--diff::
        Edit the patch diff.

-e::
--edit::
        Invoke interactive editor.

--sign::
        Add a "Signed-off-by:" to the end of the patch.

--ack::
        Add an "Acked-by:" line to the end of the patch.

-m MESSAGE::
--message MESSAGE::
        Use MESSAGE instead of invoking the editor.

-f FILE::
--file FILE::
        Use the contents of FILE instead of invoking the editor.
        (If FILE is "-", write to stdout.)

--save-template FILE::
        Instead of running the command, just write the message
        template to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
        stdout.)
+
When driving StGit from another program, it is often
useful to first call a command with '--save-template',
then let the user edit the message, and then call the
same command with '--file'.

--author "NAME <EMAIL>"::
        Set the author details.

--authname NAME::
        Set the author name.

--authemail EMAIL::
        Set the author email.

--authdate DATE::
        Set the author date.

-O OPTIONS::
--diff-opts OPTIONS::
        Extra options to pass to "git diff".

-t TREE-ISH::
--set-tree TREE-ISH::
        Set the git tree of the patch to TREE-ISH.
