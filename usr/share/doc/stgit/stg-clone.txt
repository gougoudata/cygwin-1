stg-clone(1)
============

NAME
----
stg-clone - Make a local clone of a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg' clone <repository> <dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Clone a git repository into the local directory <dir> (using
linkstg:clone[]) and initialise the local branch "master".

This operation is for example suitable to start working using the
"tracking branch" workflow (see link:stg[1]). Other means to setup
an StGit stack are linkstg:init[] and the '--create' and '--clone'
commands of linkstg:branch[].

The target directory <dir> will be created by this command, and must
not already exist.

Part of the StGit suite - see linkman:stg[1]
