yelp-xsl is a collection of programs and data files to help you build,
maintain, and distribute documentation. This package is entirely free
software; however, not all components of the package are under the same
free software license.

The GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License are
used for particular components of this package, depending on need. You should
have received a copy of both licenses with this package; see COPYING.GPL and
COPYING.LGPL. If you did not receive these files, write to the Free Software

This document attempts to provide a brief overview of the programs in this
package and their licensing terms.


XSLT
----
This package contains various XSLT files for transforming DocBook, Mallard,
and other formats. They were written primarily by Shaun McCance.

The XSLT files are released under the terms of the GNU LGPL. You may build
customizations from these stylesheets using their public documented interfaces,
using either xsl:import or xsl:include, with no restrictions on your customized
stylesheets. You may also invoke the stylesheets freely, either with a simple
XSLT processor such as xsltproc, or using an XSLT processing library within
your program. The use of these stylesheets has no bearing on the licensing
terms of the XSLT processing program you use.

The files output by the stylesheets are not affected by the terms of the LGPL.
In particular, some of the stylesheets output program files rather than simple
data files. The generated program files are also not affected by the LGPL.
You can redistribute all generated files as you see fit.


Images
------
This package contains a number of images that are used in the formatted
output. They were created primarily by Josef Vyb√≠ral. These images are
licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
copies of your document formatted by the tools in this package, you may
redistribute unmodified copies of any images used or referenced in that
formatted copy without restriction.


JavaScript
----------
This package contains copies of the jQuery JavaScript library and the
jQuery.Syntax syntax highlighter. The XSLT in this package may output
HTML that references these libraries through the src attribute of the
script tag.

The jQuery library is copyright 2010 John Resig and is dual-licensed under
the MIT and and the Gnu GPLv2 licenses. See COPYING.MIT and COPYING.GPL
for details.

The jQuery.Syntax library is copyright 2011 Samuel Williams and is licensed
under the MIT license. See COPYING.MIT for details.
