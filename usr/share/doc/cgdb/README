There is documentation available for starting and using CGDB in the doc/
directory. 
  - http://cgdb.sourceforge.net/documentation.shtml will provide you with
    an HTML view of the manual, and possibly some other formats.
  - Look at doc/cgdb.info for the info manual. 
  - The plain text version of the manual is provided here doc/cgdb.txt.
  - cgdb/doc/cgdb.1 will provide you with the man page.

If you are interested in building CGDB from CVS, please look at the 
section "Building CGDB from source" in the manual. This will describe
all of the tools necessary that you will need in order to do this.

CGDB does not package the autotool files in CVS. So, if you want to build 
CGDB from CVS, then you will need to run the script ./autogen.sh. This 
will generate all the files necessary to build CGDB. You will need to have
aclocal, autoconf, autoheader and automake installed. The specific versions
I have used are documented in ./autogen.sh. Other versions may work for you.

Your patches should be indented properly. You can use the ./indent.sh script
and it will indent the files appropriatly.

Enjoy!
