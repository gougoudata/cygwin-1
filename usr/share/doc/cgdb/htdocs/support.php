    <h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

    <div class="pagetext">
      If you need support using CGDB (reporting a bug, submitting a patch, or
      even just asking how to use features of CGDB), there are a few mailing
      lists you can join.  The mailing lists can also provide you with
      announcements of the latest releases and other important information.
      If you're interested in signing up to these mailing lists, visit:
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=72581">SourceForge 
      Mailing Lists</a>

    <h3>IRC on Freenode</h3>

    <div class="pagetext">
      As of November 2005, the CGDB maintainers will be hanging out in #cgdb
      on the Freenode IRC network.  All are welcome to come with questions,
      concerns, etc.  This might be the quickest way to get a simple question
      answered.  Honestly we're not sure though, this is the first time we're
      doing it! Remember, connect to irc.freenode.net and go to
      <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/cgdb">#cgdb</a>.
