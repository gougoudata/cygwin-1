<h3><A NAME=building-win32>Win32</A></h3>
<p>
Only Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 is supported. Also, Perl 5 is required; the
executable must be on your PATH.
</p>
<p>
To build on the command line, ensure that the directories
containing <code>msdev</code> and <code>nmake</code> are in your path,
typically by executing
the command:
<pre>
path C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/Common/MSDev98/Bin;
    C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/VC98/Bin;%path%
</pre>
<p>
(all in one long line) then run the command:

<pre>
build-win32.bat
</pre>
<p>
To build using the Visual
Studio GUI, open the workspace <code>SP.dsw</code> and build the
<code>Win32&nbsp;Release</code> configuration of the <code>all</code>
project.  You must first do a command-line build, however, to get
the perl-generated files.
</p>
<h4>Localized Win32 builds</h4>
<p>
The messages issued by the OpenSP programs have been translated 
(currently German and Swedish are supported). Although it is not
yet possible to select the language at runtime under Windows, it
is possible to select the language at build time. To do so, you
have to set the variable <code>LANG</code> in 
<code>sp-generate.mak</code> to one of the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>en</code> for English (default)
<li><code>de</code> for German
<li><code>sv</code> for Swedish
</ul>
<p>After that you have to regenerate all <code>.rc</code> files.</p>
