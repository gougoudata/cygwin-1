* Fix crash when "-m" option specified.

* Updated Translations (new "fr" translation).

Changes in OpenSP 1.5pre9

* Support for "--restricted" option to restrict parsing of web based documents
  to local files only.

Changes in OpenSP 1.5pre8

* Support for newer autoconf, gettext tools

* Added a -x command line option to osx, which allows users to
  say whether they want sdata entities transformed into PIs or treated like
  normal entities (the default is the latter, which is how osx always
  behaved before this change). Contributed by Jessica Hekman.

Changes in OpenSP 1.5pre7

* Option to produce error messages formatted as XML from Nick Kew
  enable with ./configure --enable-xml-messages

* Japanese Translation from SATO Satoru

* Changed the way in which MessageFragments identify the module within
  which their text resides (libModule, appModule, xModule) in order to
  support Windows applications that use DLLs that use SP's DLL, where
  the intervening DLLs also define messages to be used with the SP
  message handling infrastructure.  Patch contributed by Peter Newcomb
  of Epremis Corp.

* Enhancements to osx. Contributed by Jessica Perry Hekman, Dynamic Diagrams.

* Added support for the PI-based architecture use declaration syntax
  defined by Amendment 1 to ISO/IEC 10744:1997 (HyTime).  This makes
  it possible to specify architectural support attributes when using
  architectures with XML, and is generally simpler than the original
  syntax.  See http://www.y12.doe.gov/sgml/wg8/document/1985.htm for
  details.  Patch contributed by Peter Newcomb of Epremis Corp.

* Adds the architecture public id to the information passed to
  implementations of ArcDirector.  This is especially important when
  using the PI-based architecture use declaration syntax, since there
  may be no Notation object from which to get the information.  Patch
  contributed by Peter Newcomb of Epremis Corp.

Changes in OpenSP 1.5pre6

* RPM spec file updates and corrections from Terje Bless

* Adapt SP patch from Liam Quinn that adds a HTTP/1.0 Host header to HTTP

* A few minor documentation improvements, thanks to Terje Bless

* require autoconf 2.52; fix some autoconf problems for the new version
