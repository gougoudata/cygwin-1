            <dt><font face="Arial"><strong>James Clark:</strong></font></dt>
            <dd><font face="Arial">The father of Jade. James made
                the first version called Jade. He was
                instrumental to the idea of a single set of flow
                objects and multiple backend formats. James
                carried the Jade project for several years until
                it became a group project and got renamed
                OpenJade. He is no longer participating to the
                OpenJade project but his spirit still and will
                always remain with us. He created most of the
                Openjade code and the SGML/XML and the RTF
                backends. But it is shorter to tell what he didn't
                do than what he did :-)</font></dd>
            <dt><font face="Arial"><strong>Matthias Clasen:</strong></font></dt>
            <dd><font face="Arial">I am an old-time LaTeX user
                and a scheme lover. My first jade hacking
                experience was trying to use dsssl to produce
                properly formatted indexes, realizing the need
                for language-dependent string sorting. That code
                is now part of OpenJade. Since I think that the
                full power of DSSSL can only be explored with a
                reasonably complete implementation, I am working
                to fill the gaps in jade's coverage of the
                standard.</font></dd>
            <dt><font face="Arial"><strong>Avi Kivity:</strong></font></dt>
            <dd><font face="Arial">I stumbled on Jade after
                attempts to format SGML documents using C++
                proved too cumbersome. I was impressed by the
                power of DSSSL and the functional programming
                style, which I hadn't used before. My main
                interest is fully-integrated backends; that is,
                formatters which do the layout themselves and do
                not depend on external layout engines like TeX or
                Word. I also maintain the CVS repository and
                perform builds and releases. </font></dd>
            <dt><font face="Arial"><strong>Didier PH Martin:</strong></font></dt>
            <dd><font face="Arial">I encountered Jade simply by
                browsing to find new ways to process XML/SGML
                documents. I had to learn it without a book and
                with minimal documentation. The more I know about
                this environment the more I learn to appreciate
                it. This is why, I am a fervant advocate of DSSSL,
                OpenJade and work hard to provide to members of
                the OpenJade community, a rich environment, an
                adequate documentation, a future to this language.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial">After more than 20 years in
                the computer business, I still enjoy creating and
                learning. As a canadian member of the ISO
                Document Description and Processing Languages
                comittee, my goal is to make a DSSSL-2 possible
                reality. </font></dd>
