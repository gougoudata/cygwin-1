Changes in OpenJade 1.4devel

* Query rules.

* The "media", "title" and "alternate" attributes in stylesheet PIs are 
  supported according to the HTML 4.0 specification.

* A new external procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::uri-ref-address" returns an address
  object to the supplied URI. This allows hyperlinks to resources of the WWW
  in documents. Currently URI references are implemented in the HTML/CSS 
  and TeX backends.

* The command line option --help gives a summary of the usage and all
  supported command line options.

* Separate cmdline options for the two SGML parsers used for the document and
  the style-sheet.

* GNU-style long command line options are now supported in addition to the
  short ones.

* OpenJade is internationalized. Translations for many messages are available
  in German and Swedish.

* The standard flow objects check that their content is valid.

* Internal defines (ie defines at the begin of a body) are supported. 
  
* The char-map inherited characteristic is supported. 

* (test => recipient) cond clauses are supported.

* RTF output had extra spaces that were detrimental to display;
  patch from Andrey Taranov.

* Better time string support; it is possible to compare time, date and
  datetime (not only datetime). Also partial formats (like YY-MM-DD,
  YYYY-MM or HH:MM) are now supported.  Patch from Francis J. Lacoste.

* Optimize sosofo-append to reduce its memory and stack usage when
  using it to build long list of sosofos.  Patch from Francis
  J. Lacoste.

* For the TeX backend, turn on the twoside LaTeX feature by default.
  Patch from Francis J. Lacoste.

* Improve table support in the JadeTeX backend:
  - Support for nested tables.  cell-after-column-margin: and
    cell-before-column-margin: wasn't really working.
  - Row spanning was broken. This patch only supports 'start row
    alignment though.
  - Paragraphs in cell spanning multiple column are now working.
  - Support for the row-alignment: characteristic.
  - Support for cell-background? and background-color properties.
  Patch from Francis J. Lacoste.  To see benefits of this, requires
  JadeTeX 3.2 or better.

* Add support for the 'asis and 'asis-wrap values for the paragraph's
  'lines:' characteristic.  Patch from Francis J. Lacoste.

* Allow JadeTeX to resolve references to subdocs or to content
  produced through a "sgml-parse" by hacking on the NodeIndex
  instruction.  Patch from Jean-Marie Kubek.

* remove contrib/jadetex, get it from upstream if you want it

Changes in OpenJade 1.3

* The SGML backend will no emit linebreaks when used as -t sgml-raw.

* OpenJade can bind variables to arbitrary values on the command line. 

* The prlabs1 module of the SGML property set is supported.

* Style sheet extensions.dsl lists all known
  external procedures ready for easy inclusion
  as an external-specification.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::expt"
  allows to form integral powers of quantities.
  
* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::sgml-parse"
  allows to parse wrt. an architecture.

* OpenJade supports force! for inherited characteristics.

* OpenJade supports character properties.
 
* OpenJade supports special-query-expressions.

* OpenJade can bind variables to string values on the command line.

* All standard color spaces supported. 

* OpenJade ignores duplicate keywords in make expressions, as 
  mandated by DSSSL.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::language"
  to create a language object by reference to a POSIX locale.
 
* Language-dependent procedures of the expression language:
  language?, current-language, declare-default-language, 
  with-language, define-language, char<?, char>?, char<=?,
  char>=?, char-ci=?, char-ci<?, char-ci>?, char-ci<=?,
  char-ci>=?, char-upcase, char-downcase, string-ci=?,
  string-equiv?, string<?, string>?, string<=?, string>=?,
  string-ci<?, string-ci>?, string-ci<=?, string-ci>=?.

* The style-sheet.dtd derived from the dsssl architecture
  has been extended (in a backwards compatible way) to
  include the delaration element type forms supported by
  Jade. The public identifier for the dtd is 

  "-//OpenJade//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" 
  
* char-repertoire, add-name-chars and add-separator-chars
  declaration element type forms are supported. When given
  the -s cmdline flag, Jade doesn't use its builtin 
  character repertoire.
  
* Most of the derived procedures in the query language:
  current-root, node-list-reduce, node-list-contains?,
  node-list-remove-duplicates, node-list-union, 
  node-list-intersection, node-list-difference, 
  node-list-symmetric-difference, node-list-union-map,
  node-list-some?, node-list-every?, node-list-filter,
  node-list->list, node-list-tail, node-list-head,
  node-list-sublist, node-list-count, node-list-last,
  node-list-property, origin, origin-to-subnode-rel,
  tree-root, grove-root, source, subtree, subgrove,
  ancestors, grove-root-path, rsiblings, ipreced,
  ifollow, grove-before?, sort-in-tree-order, tree-before?,
  tree-before, property-lookup, select-by-property, 
  select-by-null-property, select-by-missing-property,
  attribute, referent, q-element, q-class, q-sdata.
  
Changes in OpenJade 1.2.2 

* The HTML and MIF backends are now enabled by default.

* The TeX backend has support for PDF bookmarks. This is
  supported by the new version of jadetex which is included.

* Predefined character names line-feed and carriage-return 
  for the character numbers 10 and 13.

* standard-chars and map-sdata-entity declaration element
  type forms are supported.

* Style language additions: map-constructor.
 
* + and - return a length-spec if any of there arguments
  is a length-spec.

* Most of the non-core expression language:
  c...r, assoc, keyword->string, string->keyword, exact?, inexact?,
  zero?, positive?, negative?, odd?, even?, exp, log, sin, cos,
  tan, asin, acos, atan, expt, exact->inexact, inexact->exact,
  quantity->number, string->list, list->string, map, time<?,
  time>?, time<=?, time>=?.
