Subject: my dejagnu wish list
Newsgroups: gmane.comp.sysutils.dejagnu.general

My wish list for dejagnu:

. clean up the exit status value.

  The current situation is:

    1  a FAIL, XPASS, KPASS, or UNRESOLVED result occurred
    1  an unknown TCL procedure was called
    1  --status option and a TCL error happened
    0  all other cases

  I would like to see something like:

    0  all tests are okay
    1  at least one test is not okay (FAIL, XPASS, KPASS, UNRESOLVED)
    2  a TCL error occured
  130  user hit ^C (SIGINT)
  131  user hit ^\ (SIGQUIT)

  The important part is that I want to detect whether dejagnu ran
  to completion or whether the user interrupted it with ^C or ^\.

. When the compiler produces error messages, default_target_compile
  calls "verbose -log ...".  There is no need for "-log", because
  runtest.exp already turned on "expect" logging with
  "log_file -a $outdir/$tool.log", so there is already a copy of
  the compiler output in the log file.  Just "verbose ..." or
  nothing at all.

. Reset $warncnt and $errcnt at the start of each script.  Right now,
  if an error happens in a script and then no tests are run,
  $errcnt carries over to the next script and forces the first test
  of the new script to be UNRESOLVED.
