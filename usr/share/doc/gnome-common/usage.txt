This module contains various files needed to bootstrap Gnome 2 modules
built from CVS.  It contains the following components:
 1. A common "autogen.sh" script that can be used to configure a
    source directory checked out from CVS.
 2. Some commonly used macros (quite a small set these days -- macros
    should be packaged with their respective modules).
 3. Some files used to build user documentation.

To make use of the common autogen script, create a stub autogen.sh
script in your module that looks something like this:

---- Cut Here ----
#!/bin/sh
srcdir=`dirname $0`
[ -z "$srcdir" ] && srcdir=.

PKG_NAME=mypackage
REQUIRED_AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.7

if [ ! -f "$srcdir/somefile-that-is-only-in-mypackage" ]; then
 echo "$srcdir doesn't look like source directory for $PKG_NAME" >&2
 exit 1
fi

. gnome-autogen.sh
---- Cut Here ----

Then put the following in your configure.ac or configure.in file:
  GNOME_COMMON_INIT

This macro is equivalent to the following two lines (which you can use
instead if you don't want to depend on gnome-common macros):
  AC_SUBST([ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS], ["\${ACLOCAL_FLAGS}"])

Or if you are using the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR macro:
  AC_SUBST([ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS], ["-I $ac_macro_dir \${ACLOCAL_FLAGS}"])

This will make sure that autoconf macros will be found when you
rebuild the package without rerunning autogen.sh.
