Introduction
------------

The sgml-common package gathers very basic stuff necessary to
work with SGML and XML.

They currently contain:
  - xml.dcl: SGML declaration of XML
  - iso-entities: the basic SGML ISO entities
  - install-catalog: a script used to add entries to (or remove
    entries from) centralized catalogs. These entries are pointers
    to SGML open catalogs as defined by OASIS (see TR9401:1997 on
    http://www.oasis-open.org).
  - sgmlwhich: a small script telling where SGML main configuration file
    is located (provided for compatibility with non-FHS systems)


Compatibility
-------------

The sgml-common files are inspired by the former scripts from the
DocBook-Tools distribution (hosted by Cygnus sourceware project).

They comply with FHS and LSB.
