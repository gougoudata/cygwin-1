Changes
-------

* bzr-fastimport no longer ships exporters for various other version
  control systems. The versions of these exporters shipped with bzr-fastimport
  have been outdated for some time. Better and more recent exporters
  are widely available.

Compatibility
-------------

* Avoid using Tree.inventory directly, which is deprecated in bzr 2.6.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Reimport some modules removed from python-fastimport 0.9.2.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #693507)

Improvements
------------

* Document the SOURCE argument for ``bzr fast-export``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #672926)

0.12 2012-02-09

Bug fixes
---------

* Cope with non-utf8 characters in paths when importing.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #838980)

Features
--------

* New option --rewrite-tag-names for 'bzr fast-export'. (Alex Usov, #872601)

* New option --dont-squash-empty-commits for 'bzr fast-import-filter'.
  (Alex Usov, #877303)

* Add --baseline option to ``bzr export``. (Andy Grimm, #893382)

0.11 2011-08-22

  (Jelmer Vernooij, #485788)

* Allow "bzr fast-import-filter" to be used without first argument.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #792935)

* Remove --branches-path and --tags-path options from ``bzr fast-export-from-svn``.
  These options are not supported by the underlying svn-fast-export.py yet.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #513747)

* In "plain" mode, skip tags that contain characters not valid in Git.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #386986)

* Support exporting files that are changed into directories.
  (Henrik Nyberg, #631979)

0.10 08-Mar-2011

Changes
-------

* bzr-fastimport's file parsing and generation functionality has been exported into
  separate upstream project called python-fastimport, that it now depends on.
  python-fastimport can be retrieved from http://launchpad.net/python-fastimport.

Bug fixes
---------

  (Ian Clatworthy, Jelmer Vernooij, Gabriel Filion, #347729)

* Allow entries without email address in user map. (Jelmer Vernooij, #576598)

* Strip leading slashes when exporting Subversion repositories.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #477869)

* Cope with non-utf8 characters in commit messages. (Jelmer Vernooij, #444896)

* Include download_url in setup.py for use on pypi. (Jelmer Vernooij, #456957)

* Fix incremental imports from incremental import streams.
  (termie, Jelmer Vernooij, #328494)

0.9 28-Feb-2010
===============

New Features
------------

* The fast-import command now takes an optional but recommended
  DESTINATION argument. A repository will be created at this
  location and branches will be created within there. If the user
  is running bzr 1.17 up to 2.0, format "2a" is used for these,
  otherwise the default format is used. A format can be explicitly
  given using the new --format option. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Wrapper commands simplifying the generation of fast-import
  files from other tools are now provided. The general usage is:

    bzr fast-export-from-xxx SOURCE project.fi

  Before starting an export, these commands make an effort to
  check that dependent tools are installed. So far, wrapper
  commands are available for cvs, darcs, git, hg (Mercurial),
  mnt (Monotone), p4 (Perforce) and svn (Subversion).
  (Ian Clatworthy, Matt McClure)

* darcs-fast-export is now bundled. In fact, the project has
  merged into this one for the purposes of ongoing bug fixing
  and development. (Miklos Vajna)

* fast-export now supports a --no-plain parameter which causes
  richer metadata to be included in the output using the
  recently agreed 'feature' extension capability. The features
  used are called multiple-authors, commit-properties and
  empty-directories. (Ian Clatworthy)

* fast-import and fast-import-filter now support user mapping
  via the new --user-map option. The argument is a file specifying
  how user-ids should be mapped to preferred user-ids.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* svn-fast-export now supports an address option (to control the
  default email domain) and a first-rev option (to select revisions
  since a given one). (Ted Gould)

Improvements
------------

* Large repositories now compress better thanks to a change in
  how file-ids are assigned. (Ian Clatworthy, John Arbash Meinel)

* Memory usage is improved by flushing blobs to a disk cache
  when appropriate. (John Arbash Meinel)

* If a fast-import source ends in ".gz", it is assumed to be in
  gzip format and the stream is implicitly uncompressed. This
  means fast-import dump files generated by fast-export-from-xxx
  can be stored gzipped to save space. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The working tree is now implicitly updated for trunk. Other
  branches still need to be explicitly created using 'bzr update'.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Directories that become empty following a delete or rename of
  one of their children are now implicitly pruned. If required,
  this will be made optional at a later date.
  (Tom Widmer, Ian Clatworthy)

* Blob tracking is now more intelligently done by an implicit
  first pass to collect blob usage statistics. This eliminates
  the need for an explicit 2-step process in all cases except
  where stdin is used as the input source. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Updated the bundled version of hg-fast-export to be the latest
  code (25-May-2009) from http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed the format used to create branches in a shared repository.
  It now selects the best branch format based on the repository
  format, rather than assume the default branch format is the right
  one. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fixed inventory delta generation when deleting directories.
  (Previously the child paths included were relative to the
  directory when they ought to be relative to the root.)
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Gracefully handle email addresses with unicode characters.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Gracefully handle an empty input stream. (Gonéri Le Bouder)

* Gracefully handle git submodules by ignoring them.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Get git-bzr working again. (Gonéri Le Bouder)

Documentation
-------------

* Improved documentation has been published in the Bazaar Data Migration
  Guide: http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/migration/en/data-migration/.


0.8 22-Jul-2009
===============

Compatibility Breaks
--------------------

* ``exporters/bzr-fast-export`` has been replaced with a
  ``fast-export`` command. Some minor issues have been
  fixed at the same time: the first commit now goes into
  refs/heads/master (not refs/head/tmp); there's no
  checkpoint at the top of the stream; parent commits are
  now always given lower mark numbers than the commits they
  are merged into. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``fast-import`` command now uses a different mapping of
  git reference names to bzr branch names. In summary:
  
  * ``refs/heads/foo`` is mapped to ``foo``
  * ``refs/remotes/origin/foo`` is mapped to ``foo.remote``
  * ``refs/tags/foo`` is mapped to ``foo.tag``
  * ``*/master`` is mapped to ``trunk``, ``trunk.remote``, etc.
  * ``*/trunk`` is mapped to ``git-trunk``, ``git-trunk.remote``, etc.

  This new mapping has been introduced so that more natural
  branch names are used and to enable round-tripping back to git.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The old ``fast-import-filter`` command is now called
  ``fast-import-query``. ``fast-import-filter`` now
  really filters the input to produce a fast-import stream
  based on filtering criteria. See below.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``--inv-fulltext`` option is no longer supported. It was
  only used in experimental mode for old versions of bzrlib so
  it added more complexity than value. (Ian Clatworthy)

New Features
------------

* Added ``fast-import-filter`` command for splitting out a
  subdirectory or bunch of files into their own project. It can
  also be used to create a new repository without any history
  for nominated files and directories. This is useful for
  removing information which is a security risk, huge binary
  files like ISO images, etc.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Copying of files and symbolic links is now supported.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Initial cut at reset support. (Brian de Alwis, Ian Clatworthy)

Improvements
------------

* If ``refs/heads/xxx`` and ``refs/remotes/origin/xxx`` are both
  defined, the latter is now mapped to a bzr branch called
  ``xxx.remote`` rather than ``remotes--origins--xxx``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr fast-import-info`` now handles an unlimited # of parents for a
  revision. The spec suggests the maximum ought to be 16 but the linux
  kernel has revisions with more than that.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr fast-import-info`` now reports on things that may need caching,
  i.e. merges, rename old paths and copy source paths.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Tag commands with a missing from clause now produce a warning but
  are otherwise ignored. (Scott James Remnant, Ian Clatworthy)

* The fastimport-id-map file can now have more revisions than the
  repository. (Scott James Remnant)

* Updated the bundled version of hg-fast-export to be the latest
  code from http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git. It should now
  support recent Mercurial releases.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #318903)

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a *bad* bug where filecopy commands were being parsed
  as filerename commands. Repositories generated by previous
  version of bzr-fast-import where the input stream contained
  filecopy commands might be missing data (the copy source will
  no longer be there if it was unchanged since the copy happened)
  and ought to be regenerated.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fixed how the per-file graph is generated. The per-file graph
  may still be less than perfect in the case where a file is only
  changed in a merge and not the parent, but in the vast majority
  of cases now, ``bzr check`` should no longer report inconsistent
  parents. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fix ``os`` import as needed on Windows.
  (Ian Clatworthy, esskov, #264988)

* Handle a directory turning into a file and then the children
  of that directory being deleted.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #309486)

* Handle an empty email section.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Handle multiple merges within the one merge clause. That's illegal
  according to the spec but git-fast-export does it.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #259711)

* Handle names and paths that aren't utf8 encoded. The spec recommends
  utf8 encoding of these but git-fast-export doesn't always do that.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #289088)

* Ignore lightweight tags with no from clause rather than abort.
  (It seems git-fast-export outputs these commands frequently now
  while it didn't appear to in early versions.)
  (Ian Clatworthy, edice, #259711)

* Import into rich-root (and subtree) repositories without aborting.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #300921)

* Recursively delete children when a directory is deleted.
  (Scott James Remnant)

* The ``deleteall`` command now only tries to delete files in the
  nominated branch, not all known files. As a consequence,
  it should now be possible (if it wasn't before) to import
  multiple Darcs branches (via darcs-fast-export) at once.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Testing
-------

* A large number of tests have been added.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
---------

* Refactored ``processors/generic_processor.py`` into a bunch of modules.
  (Ian Clatworthy)


0.7 09-Feb-2009
===============

Compatibility Breaks
--------------------

* bzr-fast-export.py renamed to bzr-fast-export.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
------------

* Add support for the deleteall command.
  (Miklos Vajna, #284941)

Bug Fixes
---------

* bzr-fast-export now exports rm+mv correctly.
  (Jonas)

* Fix recursive rename handling in bzr-fast-export.
  (Pieter de Bie, #287785)

* hg-fast-export should use binary mode on Windows.
  (Alexey Stukalov)

* setup.py no longer assumes python2.4.
  (schickb@gmail.com)

* setup.py support fixed.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Update the last-modified revision for a renamed file.
  (John Arbash Meinel)


0.6 23-Jul-2008
===============

Improvements
------------

* Added NEWS containing Release Notes. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr help fastimport`` now provides help that is useful.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Numerous fixes to ``bzr-fast-export.py`` to improve round-tripping
  with Git. Added ``--import-marks`` and ``--export-marks`` options
  to ``fast-import`` as well.
  (Pieter de Bie)

* ``svn-fast-export.py`` now supports a regular-expression to specify
  the branches to export.
  (Mirko Friedenhagen)

Bug Fixes
---------

* Support the new Repository API added in bzr.dev r3510. The old API
  will be used for earlier versions of bzr including bzr 1.6beta2 and
  earlier. (Ian Clatworthy)

Compatibility Breaks
--------------------

* The ``--inv-fulltext`` option is not yet supported when the new
  Repository API is used to import revisions. The option can be
  provided but it will be ignored. (Ian Clatworthy)

API Breaks

* The ``RevisionLoader`` class has been renamed to ``RevisionLoader1``.
  The ``ExperimentalRevisionLoader`` class has been renamed to
  ``ImportRevisionLoader1``. New classes called ``RevisionLoader2``
  and ``ImportRevisionLoader2`` are provided that use the new
  Repository API. (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
---------

* Improved packaging by adding a setup.py file. (Ian Clatworthy)


0.5 02-Jun-2008
===============

* Version suitable for Bazaar 1.5.
  (Ian Clatworthy)
