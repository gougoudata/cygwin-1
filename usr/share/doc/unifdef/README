unifdef - selectively remove C preprocessor conditionals

Written by Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at> - http://dotat.at/prog/unifdef/

The unifdef utility selectively processes conditional C preprocessor
#if and #ifdef directives. It removes from a file both the directives
and the additional text that they delimit, while otherwise leaving the
file alone.

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Pre-formatted documentation can be found in unifdef.txt
