Port Notes:
----------  cygutils-1.4.12-1 -- 2013-04-27 -----------
* winln: new ln workalike that produces "native" windows
  shortcuts. Daniel Colascione.
* Build fixes adapting to new w32api.
* Bugfixes for lpr and readshortcut (already present in
  1.4.10-2 cygwin release).
* Update to recent autoconf, automake, and gettext.
* Added debuginfo subpackage.
* First 64bit build.

----------  cygutils-1.4.10-2 -- 2012-04-13 -----------
* readshortcut --raw was always "on"
* longstanding issue with lpr printer name "normalization corrected.
* readshortcut now handles embedded "windows" environment variables
  (%foo%) correctly.

----------  cygutils-1.4.10-1 -- 2012-04-12 -----------
* getclip and putclip now support new cygwin-1.7.13+ clipboard format.
* cygstart now supports file:// and mailto: URLs (Yaakov Selkowitz)
* Added -R/--raw option to readshortcut (prevents expanding embedded
  environment variables within paths). Reported by Denis Excoffier.
* mkshortcut, readshortcut and lpr now use cygwin-1.7 path conversion
  functions rather than deprecated ones. However, they make only
  minimal concessions to unicode, and operate mostly on narrow character
  encoded pathnames. They should now be able to handle "long" pathnames
  however.

----------  cygutils-1.4.8-1 -- 2012-02-09 -----------
* Integrate cygstart with FD.o menu and mimetype system.
  (Yaakov Selkowitz)
* Remove ascii utility; replaced by separate package derived
  from ESR's implementation http://catb.org/~esr/ascii/
* Remove realpath utility; replaced by new implementation
  provided by coreutils (8.15 and above).

----------  cygutils-1.4.6-1 -- 2011-04-28 -----------
* conv: no longer distribute as dos2unix, unix2dos, u2d, or d2u.
  Those programs now available from the separate dos2unix package.
* ascii: by default, now only prints characters 0..127. Use new
  option --extended/-e for old behavior, printing characters 0..255.
  See this thread: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2010-04/msg00600.html
* cygstart: Fix --reference. Allow relative paths (enables, e.g.
  'cygstart calc'). Reported by Ken Hirsch.
  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2010-01/msg01101.html
* cygdrop: Minor fixes (Christian Franke)
* mkshortcut: Minor fixes (Jon TURNEY)
* Updated licenses for all apps to GPLv3+ (with permission from
  all original contributors).

----------  cygutils-1.4.4-1 -- 2010-08-15 -----------
* Fix longstanding bug in mkshortcut, in which failure was
  reported even on success (Andy Koppe).

  to stdout instead of stderr
* Add standard command line options to cygdrop (--version,
  --help, --license, --usage)
* Various internal code cleanups

----------  cygutils-1.4.2-1 -- 2009-12-28 -----------

* Add --help option to lpr.
* Build system improvements.

* Many of the utilities have been relicensed as GPLv3+.
* Compile using gcc4

----------  cygutils-1.4.0-1 -- 2009-05-06 -----------
* First release from cygwin-1.7-specific branch. 
  cygutils-1.4.0 and above require functions not present
  in cygwin-1.5 and earlier. Legacy systems should use
  the BRANCH_1_3_x branch tag.
* Support in cygstart for unicode arguments/filenames
  (from IWAMURO Motonori).
* All applications that have a --version option now
  report the package version number with uniform format.
* All code reformatted to follow (mostly) GNU standards.

----------  cygutils-1.3.4-10 -- 2009-04-22 -----------
* Fix installation bug exposed by new libtool. Reported
  by Jerry Hedden and David Rothenberger)

----------  cygutils-1.3.3-10 -- 2009-04-21 -----------

  libtool, and gettext.

----------  cygutils-1.3.2-1 -- 2007-08-25 -----------
* Now installs "package" documentation in addition to typical
  cygwin README.
* New "utility": the cygicons DLL provides a number of cygwin-
  related icons, collected from free (as in speech) sources.
  This includes the traditional black and green cygwin 'C' --
  in several colors -- as well as the angular 'cygwing' icons,
  the hand-rendered 'cygwinshiny' icon, and a fully
  GIMPified icon from the kde-looks website. 

----------  cygutils-1.3.1-1 -- 2006-12-12 -----------

  from Michael Schaap.
* Update to latest autotools (ac-2.61, am-1.10, gt-0.15)
* Many other improvements to internal build system -- now
  passes 'make distcheck'
* Switch to cygport build framework for cygwin packages

----------  cygutils-1.3.0-1 -- 2006-03-20 -----------
* Remove many programs now offered by the util-linux package
  including: cal     col      colcrt  colrm   column  ddate 
             getopt  mcookie  namei   rename  rev

----------  cygutils-1.2.10-1 -- 2006-02-10 -----------
* cygstart - properly convert environment variables to Win32
* cygstart - don't parse options listed after the command

1.2.9-1 -----------------
* fix coredump and memleak in readshortcut (cgf)

1.2.8-1 -----------------
* updates to cygstart (Michael Schaap)
* mingw compatibility for dump (Kees Zeelenberg)

1.2.7-1 -----------------
* updates to cygstart (Anthony Derosa, Michael Schaap)
* added 'rename' program (Christopher Faylor)

1.2.6-1 -----------------
* remove readlink (now provided by coreutils)
* add new --force/--safe options to conv/d2u/u2d.  Change behavior
  for "mixed" file; always convert line endings to desired target, 
  unless input file is binary (identified by presence of '\0' bytes).

1.2.5-1 -----------------
* Add new -s (startup norm|max|min mode) to mkshortcut
* Add new -d|--desc option for mkshortcut (to control the
  'description' field == tooltip text)

1.2.4-1 -----------------
* Remove ipcs and ipcrm (now provided by cygwin itself)
* update ipck to work both with ipcs/ipcrm from cygwin/cygsever,
  and with ipcscygipc/ipcrmcygipc from cygipc.
* Only build IPC utilities against cygserver, not cygipc
  (cygipc versions now provided by the cygipc package itself)

1.2.3-1 -----------------
unreleased
1.2.2-1 -----------------
* Major rewrite of the getclip/putclip programs --
  now supports --dos/--unix/--noconv modes for
  translation of clips (Rob Siklos)

1.2.1-2 -----------------
* This is the cygwin-1.5.2 FLAG DAY release.

1.2.1-1 -----------------
* Update to 1.2.1 release.  This is the cygwin-1.5.1 FLAG DAY
  release.  This package requires cygwin-1.5.1 to work.
* Moved documentation to /usr/share/*
* Because cygipc is now a DLL, we SHOULD list cygipc as
  a requirement for cygutils.  But, I don't really want
  to do that.  So I won't.  It shouldn't matter, anyway: the
  other progs will be fine without libcygipc, and the ipc tools
  don't work if ipc-daemon2.exe isn't running.  But, the
  only way for ipc-daemon2.exe to run, is if libcygipc is
  installed.  So, we're covered.

1.2.0-1 -----------------
* Update to 1.2.0 release.  This is the cygwin-1.5.0 FLAG DAY
  release.  This package requires cygwin-1.5.0 to work.
* Added ipc utilities, now that cygipc is part of the 
  official distribution.  I still hope that cygipc becomes
  obsolete soon, but when it does these utilities will be
  compiled against the cygserver libraries instead.
  - Of course, these utilities won't work properly if 
  ipc-daemon2.exe is not running, but as libcygipc is static
  we do not need to list the cygipc package as a *requirement*
  for this one.

1.1.4-2 -----------------
* Fix slight bug in lpr (gilles civario)

1.1.4-1 -----------------
* Rick Rankin provided a reimplementation of lpr.
* mkshortcut supports a new -w/--workingdir option.

1.1.3-----------------
* removed last and utmpdump (now provided by the sysvinit package)
* removed the postinstall script (only last/utmpdump needed it)
* mkshortcut now uses popt
