quilt
------------------------------------------

Tool to work with series of patches

Program manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes each
of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack
(push/pop). Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a
package received as a tarball or maintained in another version control
system. The stacked organization proved to be efficient for the
management of very large patch sets (more than hundred patches).

With quilt, all work occurs within a single directory tree. Since
version 0.30, commands can be invoqued from anywhere within the source
tree. Commands are of the form quilt cmd, similar to CVS commands.
They can be abbreviated as long as the specified part of the command
is unique. All commands print some help text with "quilt cmd -h".

An example:

  cat some.txt
  quilt new mychange.dif

  EDITOR=vi quit edit some.text
  ... edit, exit
  quilt refresh

  ls patches/*

  quilt diff -z
  quilt refresh
  quilt pop                   # remove patch
  quilt push                  # reapply
