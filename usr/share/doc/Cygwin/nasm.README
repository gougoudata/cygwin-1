Building
--------

Dependencies:
  autoconf, perl, gcc4, gettext-devel, cygport

The package was built automatically using cygport.
If you want to achieve the same build yourself:

  tar xjf nasm-2.10.05-1-src.tar.bz2
  cygport ./nasm-2.10.05-1.cygport all

Which builds nasm, ndisasm and rdoff tools, and their html, info and 
man pages.  It then installs everything that has been built.

See the upstream INSTALL file in the package root for the original 
build instructions.
