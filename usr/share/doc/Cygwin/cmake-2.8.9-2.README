Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.5.21(0.156/4/2) or newer

Build requirements
  cygwin-1.5.21(0.156/4/2) or newer
  make

------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack cmake-2.8.9-2-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
         unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  ./cmake-2.8.9-2.sh all

This will create:
  /usr/src/cmake-2.8.9.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/cmake-2.8.9-2-src.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------

Port Notes:

The directory /usr/share/cmake-2.8.9/include is purposely not
located at /usr/include/cmake-2.8.9 or /usr/include/cmake.  The
files it contains are not meant for inclusion in any C or C++ program.
They are used for compiling dynamically loadable CMake commands inside
projects that provide them.  CMake will automatically provide the
proper include path when the files are needed.
