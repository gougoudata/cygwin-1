wget 1.13.4-1
------------------------------------------

GNU Wget: Utility to retrieve files from the WWW via HTTP and FTP

The fact that Windows is case insensitive means that if a web site has
both Index.html and index.html, wget will download both and overwrite
one of them, unless you turn on case sensitivity.

Runtime requirements (these or newer):
  cygwin-1.7.9-1
  libgnutls26-2.8.6-1
  libiconv2-1.14-2
  libidn11-1.18-1
  libintl8-0.18.1.1-2

Additional build conditions (these or newer):
  binutils-2.21.53-2
  cygport-0.10.5-1
  gcc4-4.5.3-2
  gettext-0.18.1.1-2
  gettext-devel-0.18.1.1-2
  gnutls-devel-2.8.6-1
  libiconv-1.14-2
  libidn-devel-1.18-1

Build instructions:
  unpack wget-1.13.4-1-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
    unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport wget-1.13.4-1 all

This will create:
  /usr/src/wget-1.13.4-1.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/wget-1.13.4-1-src.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport wget-1.13.4-1 prep' to get a patched source directory

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can use
"cygcheck -l wget", or browse the listing for the appropriate
version at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.
