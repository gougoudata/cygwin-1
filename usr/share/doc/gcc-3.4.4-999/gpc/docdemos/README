GPC Manual Demo Programs
************************

These GPC demo programs are part of the GPC Manual. When you read
the GPC Manual, and come across the demo programs printed in it, you
do not have to type them in, but you will find them here, ready to
be compiled.

Most of the programs do not serve any useful purpose by themselves,
they are just short examples of using certain GPC features.

You can find some more interesting and longer demo programs in the
directory `demos'.

The license under which the docdemo programs are released can be
found in the file `COPYING.DEMO'.
