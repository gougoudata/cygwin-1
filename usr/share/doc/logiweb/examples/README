To compile sources in /usr/share/doc/logiweb/examples:

> mkdir foo
> cp /usr/share/doc/logiweb/examples/* foo
> cd foo
> gunzip *.gz    # if needed
> lgc base.lgs

If you get a segfault or a message about overflow of the C stack,
try this if you run bash or similar: ulimit -s unlimited
try this if you run  csh or similar: unlimit stacksize
try this if you run Cygwin:          Add more RAM
'lgc base' is known to work with 2 GB RAM

Have a look at the result of 'lgc base.lgs':
> firefox base/index.html &

Then compile whatever other pages you like.

Dependencies are:

base -> lgc
base -> combinations
base -> check
check -> test
check -> Peano
Peano -> multzero
test, Peano -> testmachine

In other words, you cannot do 'lgc Peano.lgs' before you do 'lgc check.lgs'.
In turn, you cannot do 'lgc check.lgs' before you do 'lgc base.lgs'.

To compile everything under /tmp, just type 'make'.
