D-Bus AT-SPI
------------

This version of at-spi is a major break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

TODO items is kept up to date at:

More information
----------------

The project was started with a D-Bus performance review
the results of which are available on the GNOME wiki. Keep in
mind that the D-Bus AT-SPI design documents on this page
have not been kept up to date.

Contents of this package
------------------------

This package includes the protocol definitions for the new D-Bus
at-spi.

Also included is the daemon neccessary for forwarding device events
and registering accessible applicaitons.


Directory structure
-------------------

The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

    xml 

        This directory contains XML documents describing
        the D-Bus protocol in a subset of Telepathy XML.

    tools

        Miscellaneous tools. Mostly for converting protocol
        XML into D-Bus introspection, 'C' types and documentation.

    registryd

        The registry daemon code. The registry daemon
        keeps a register of accessible applications and presents
        this to clients (ATs).
        It is also responsible for delivering device events.
