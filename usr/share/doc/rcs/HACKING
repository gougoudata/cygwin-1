HACKING RCS                                             -*- org -*-

* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** next -- stuff for the next release
    This branch is work for the next release.  It will never be rebased.
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    A rebase MUST be announced to the bug-report address.
    Hackers probably want to start here.
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.

* gnulib utility
*** why
    We like gnulib, even though it is frightening at first.

    Part of the fear is from ceding precise control to a system that
    mutates w/o clear signals of stability.  Often, too, the mutation
    involves growth, both in individual modules and in the connections
    between them.  It is difficult to predict if an update will pull in
    half (or more) of "libc".  (Excepting the last, all these points
    could be said of RCS source itself, of course. ;-)

    To assuage these fears, we monitor the gnulib "utility", i.e., the
    ratio of explicitly requested modules to the currently-installed
    set.  The higher this ratio, the more control we (imagine we) have.

*** how
    Unfortunately, gnulib-tool has no ‘--print-installation’ command.
    Thus, we create (informational, not distributed) file [[file:.gnulib-utility][.gnulib-utility]]
    as a side-effect of running [[file:autogen.sh][autogen.sh]].

    #+END:

* possible future changes (see [[file:doc/rcs.texi::@node.*missing][manual]] for the more feasible ones)

*** Bring back sccstorcs.

*** Add a way to put only the interesting part of the filename into
    the $Header keyword expansion.

*** rcs should be able to fix minor mistakes in checkin dates and authors.

*** Add a new option to rcs that behaves like -o, but that doesn't lose the
    nonempty log messages, but instead merges them with the next revision if
    it exists, perhaps with a 1-line header containing author, date, etc.

*** Add options to allow arbitrary combinations of working file names
    with RCS file names -- they shouldn't have to match.

*** Add an option to rcs -o so that old log messages are not deleted if
    the next undeleted revision exists, but are merely appended to the log
    message of that revision.

*** ci -k should be able to get keyword values from the first ‘$Log’ entry.

* require a change to RCS file format

*** Allow keyword expansion to be changed on a per-revision basis,
    not on a per-file basis as now.  This would allow -ko to be used on
    imported revisions, with the default -kkv otherwise.

*** When two or more branches are merged, record all the ancestors
    of the new revision.  The hard part of this is keeping track of all the
    ancestors of a working file while it's checked out.

*** Add loose locking, which is like non-strict but applies to all users,
    not just the owner of the RCS file.

*** Be able to store RCS files in compressed format.
    Don't bother to use a .Z extension that would exceed file name length
    limits; just look at the magic number.

*** Add locker commentary, e.g. ‘co -l -m"checkout to fix merge bug" foo’
    to tell others why you checked out ‘foo’.  Also record the time when the
    revision was locked, and perhaps the working filename (if applicable).

*** Let the user mark an RCS revision as deleted; checking out such a revision
    would result in no working file.  Similarly, using ‘co -d’ with a date
    either before the initial revision or after the file was marked deleted
    should remove the working file.  For extra credit, extend the notion of
    ‘deleted’ to include ‘renamed’.  RCS should support arbitrary combinations
    of renaming and deletion, e.g. renaming A to B and B to A, checking in new
    revisions to both files, and then renaming them back.

*** Be able to check in an entire directory structure into a single RCS file.

*** Use a better scheme for locking revisions; the current scheme requires
    changing the RCS file just to lock or unlock a revision.  The new scheme
    should coexist as well as possible with older versions of RCS, and should
    avoid the rare NFS bugs mentioned in rcsedit.c.  E.g. if there's a
    reliable lockd running, RCS should use it instead of relying on NFS.

*** Add rcs options for changing keyword names, e.g. XConsortium instead of Id.

*** Add a ‘$Description’ keyword; but this may be tricky,
    since descriptions can contain newlines and $s.

*** Add a ‘$Copyright’ keyword that expands to a copyright notice.

*** Add frozen branches a la SCCS.
    In general, be able to emulate all of SCCS, so that an SCCS-to-RCS program
    can be practical.  For example, there should be an equivalent to the SCCS
    prt command.

*** Add support for distributed RCS,
    where widely separated users cannot easily access each others' RCS files,
    and must periodically distribute and reconcile new revisions.

*** Be able to create empty branches.

*** Be able to store just deltas from a read-only principal copy,
    e.g. from source on CD-ROM.

*** Improve RCS's method for storing binary files.
    Although it is more efficient than SCCS's, the diff algorithm is still
    line oriented, and often generates long output for minor changes to an
    executable file.

*** IWBN if RCS detected and handled binary files without human intervention,
    switching expansion methods as needed from revision to revision.

*** Determine automagically whether -ko or -kb should be the default.
    Do this by inspecting the file's contents or name.  The magic should
    be optional and user-programmable.

*** Extend the ,v grammar so that keywords need not be in a fixed order.

*** Internationalize messages.
    This requires a change in RCS file format because of the ‘empty log
    message’ and ‘checked in with -k’ hacks inside RCS files.
