yelp-tools is a collection of scripts and build utilities to help create,

it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

As an exception to the GPL, if you use the included yelp.m4 file as
part of your build process, you may redistribute it along with your
package without any restriction.

Note that this package builds heavily on the yelp-xsl package. For
example, it provides command-line utilities to build HTML using the
XSLT, Javascript, CSS, and images from yelp-xsl. The yelp-xsl license
grants exceptions to the GPL for redistribution of some of these files
when distributed as part of a built document using its tools. These
exceptions are also granted when using the tools in this package.
