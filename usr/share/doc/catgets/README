This package contains the Catgets component of the GNU C library.
The code was extracted from Version 2.3.5 of the GNU C library
in May 2005.  The purpose of the package is for use in environments
that don't have the GNU C library, most notably Cygwin.

The Catgets component consists of:

 - The Gencat program, which generates a message catalog.

 - The catopen(), catclose(), and catgets() C programming library
   routines which access a message catalog.

Many programs written for GNU/Linux use Catgets, so if you want to use
these programs on Cygwin, you need this package.

Many of the files in the Catgets package have comments saying they
are part of the GNU C Library.  It's not true, of course -- they are
just copies of files that are part of the GNU C Library.


To build the package, just do a 'make' in the top directory.

'make install' installs the files in likely locations
('make install --dry-run' to see where).  Set the PREFIX make variable
to install them in a special install directory.  e.g.
'make install PREFIX=/tmp/catgets'.
