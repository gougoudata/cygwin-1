Substantially all of the code in this package (Catgets) is from a file
downloaded from http://gtp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc by Bryan Henderson in May
2005, which is ostensibly the GNU C Library.  The Free Software
Foundation (FSF) appears to be the sole copyright owner of the Catgets
component of the GNU C Library.  Bryan made some trivial changes to
the code to make it compile outside of the GNU C library environment,
and hereby contributes any copyrightable interest in those changes to
the public domain.  So FSF would appear to be the sole copyright owner
of the Catgets package.  Bryan copied, modified, and redistributed the
code, under a Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from FSF.  Others
redistributed it under a chain of LGPLs going back that original
FSF-Bryan LGPL, and consequently offer it to you under LGPL.
