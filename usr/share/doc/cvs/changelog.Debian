cvs (1.10.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made fully FHS compliant.
  * Corrected description of CVS in the control file (Closes: #45900).
  * Now use make realclean not make distclean, since this cleans up the
    info files etc.
  * Patched the cvsclient.texi file to add directory entry.
  * Changed libdiff's defined location of "pr" to "/usr/bin/pr", not
    "/bin/pr" (so cvs diff --paginate will work now).
  * Fixed locations of csh and perl in configure script permanently,
    so it will build using these (policy) locations no matter what
    the builder has installed.
  * Fixed doc-base stuff (removed texinfo and info documents).
  * Now call dh_installinfo, and with the info filenames directly
    rather than using the file debian/cvs-doc.info, so info files
    are now correctly installed.
  * cvs-doc is now lintian-clean.
  * The only "real" lintian error in cvs is now the lack of manpage
    for rcs2log.
  * Changed to using my @debian.org address for maintainer field.
  * Make the user press enter after encountering any of the important
    messages in preinst/postinst. Closes: #45573
  * Fix a couple of small bugs.
     - The cvsconfig man page wasn't being installed.
     - The `cvsbug' script was being installed (bugs should be
       reported via the Debian BTS).
  * Missed the bugs filed against cvs-doc last time.
     - cvs-doc no longer recommends: cvs (closes: #41136)
     - Closes: #31273 since it was fixed in 1.10.7-1.
  * Patches to the info files (sent upstream) to make options about
    modules clearer (closes: #10162).
  * Patches to the man page to mention the 'init' command (closes: #7955,
    #10246) (also sent upstream).
  * Patch to the info files to make clear that :server: is not supported
    on the Debian version (closes: #10437).
  * 1.10.7-1 should not have closed #29548, this was a typo (but did no
    harm since the bug had been closed anyway previously).
    Closes: #29458.
