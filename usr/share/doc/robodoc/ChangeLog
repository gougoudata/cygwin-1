May 2004 - V4.99.0
 o Fixed XML DocBook output, it appears that 4.0.24 created
   invalid XML files.
 o Added smart formatting.  Instead of using preformatted text,
   that is copying the header text verbatim into the output document,
   ROBODoc tries to determine the structure of the text from
   the indentation and use of special characters.

    For instance
       This is a list:
       o list item 1,
       o list item 2.

    Will be translated into the appropriate commands to create a similar
    list in the output format.

 Frans Slothouber
 o Update of the user manual and documentation
 o Note that:
    If you were using an 'extensions:' block in your robodoc.rc file, 
    you have to replace this with an 'ignore files:' block with all
    extensions prefixed with '*'.  So, if you were using

    extensions:
        .txt
        .obj

   scans for sourcefiles.
 o Added headermarker !**** for Fortran
 o ROBODoc now warns if it finds something that looks like an item name but is
   not in the list of item names.  This catches spelling mistakes like NAEM,

   will recognize only that particular remark marker for the remaining
   part of the header.

August 2001  DCD Changes - V3.2.4 with docbook support:
  o Added support for Docbook SGML - Robodoc can now produce
    output in Docbook SGML using the DBSGML command line switch,
    allowing standardized conversion to a host of formats
    including HTML (single and multiple), RTF, ASCII, LATEX, 
    and PDF. Docbook also
    allows you to use external style sheets in which you can
    change the look of your document. See www.docbook.org for more
    on DocBook
  o Added -rh switch which causes Robodoc to scan for a single header
    defined as *ROBODOC* (char *robo_header) instead of header_markers
    and uses *ROBODOC_END* as the end marker.
    This prevents problems with Robodoc becoming confused with
    normal comments uing *. It is particularly helpful in scanning
    PHP source. It will only work with languages that support
    multiline c-style comments
  o Added -nt switch. Only used in DBSGML mode when creating a master
    index. This causes Robodoc to list the Master Index functions as
    a section 3 level item rather than as part of a table.
  o Added genrd, a Unix bash shell script which simplifies the use
    of Robodoc when generating documents from multiple source files
    and when creating crossreferences and a master index.
    Whole directories and subdirectories of source code can be
    scanned and documented with a one line statement rather than
    having to construct a makefile or using multiple
    robodoc statements. See genrd -h for more info.

Sepetember 2000 - Frans Slothouber (V3.2.3)
 o Added a descrip.mms file for compilation under VMS
 o make install installs additional documentation.

July 2000 - Frans Slothouber (V3.2.2)
 o Documentation explains how to use ROBODoc when your sources are
   in several subdirectories.
 o Documentation explains master index file for LaTeX, how to view
   the generated documentation, and the new options, NOSOURCE, SINGLEDOC
   and TITLE.
 o example makefile includes commands to view the
   generated documentation.
 o Updated the man page
 o Added option SINGLEDOC
     For LaTeX output this generates documentation without
     the start and end headers.  This way the generated file
     can be included in a master file.
 o Added master index file for LaTeX output.  The documentation
     gathered from several source files can now be included into
     one big file.
 o Added the option NOSOURCE.  With this option the SOURCE item
   is not included in the documentation.
 o Added the TITLE option. This allows to set the title for
   the master index file.
 o Made the search for headermarkers case insensitve.
   REM == Rem == rem

   "::". This is used for C++ methods.
 o added a RB_Function_Name() function that correctly extracts the
   function name (or the name of any other object that is documented)
   from the header name.  The old code used RB_FilePart which failed
   on C++ method names.
 o Fixed a core-dumping bug in RB_Set_Doc_Base()

December 1999 - Frans Slothouber (v3.1d)
 o Added list of possible item names to the robodoc man page.

   master index file and new header types.

   functions, strutures and constants. (Idea of Stefan Kost)
 o added a command to create a master index file that contains
   sorted pointers to all classes, methods, variables,
   functions, strutures and constants.

December 1999 - Frans Slothouber (v3.1c)
 o Added testheader.c for debug purposes.
 o Split the source code into serveral files.

   these items are already used in os3.1 autodocs
   TAGS, COMMANDS, DERIVED FROM, DERIVED BY, USES,
   CHILDREN, USED BY, PARENTS, USAGE, PURPOSE
 o commented the item names
 o changed item-type enums to end all with _ITEM
 o changed RB_Find_Link to accept names ending with '...'
 o changed copyright comment to be a style-guide conform version string.

   when compiling with NOANSI on SAS C/C++

November 1999 - Frans Slothouber (v3.1b)
  o Added a man page
  o Cleaned-up html documentation.
  o <A NAME="source code file name"> is generated at the beginning of
    each document. A mention of the source code name in another
    document creates a link to this name (provided you use xrefs).
 o Moved most #defines and enums to robodoc.h
 o Made ROBODoc more forgiving in reading the xrefs file. Empty
   lines are allowed and also spaces at the end of a file name.

August 1999 - Frans Slothouber: v3.1

 o Converted the documentation to HTML
 o Spell-checked all documentation
