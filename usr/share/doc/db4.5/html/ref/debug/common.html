<h3 align=center>Troubleshooting common Berkeley DB problems</h3>
<p>The following are some common problems that applications encounter.
For the answers to more Frequently Asked Questions, see the
Berkeley DB Reference Guide FAQ sections, typically located at the end
of each chapter.</p>
<ol>
<p><li><b>A Berkeley DB method is returning "argument invalid" (EINVAL) or other general
error value, or throwing a general exception, and the cause is not
obvious.  Or, a Berkeley DB method is returning an out-of-memory (ENOMEM)
error and there is plenty of disk and heap space available.</b>
<p>The application is calling the Berkeley DB API incorrectly or configuring the
database environment with insufficient resources.</p>
<p>The Berkeley DB library optionally outputs a verbose error message whenever
it is about to return a general-purpose error, or throw a non-specific
exception.  Whenever it is not clear why an application call into Berkeley DB
is failing, the first step is always to turn on verbose error messages,
which will almost always explain the problem.  See the
<a href="../../ref/debug/runtime.html">Run-time error information</a>
section of the Reference Guide for more information.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>Multiple databases are being created in a single physical file and there
is random database corruption.</b>
<p>The databases do not share an underlying database cache.  Databases that
share a single physical file must almost always share an underlying
database cache as well.  See the <a href="../../ref/am/opensub.html">Opening multiple databases in a single file</a> section of the Reference
Guide for more information.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>There are random failures when creating a database environment, often
associated with creating or initializing the shared memory regions that
back the database environment.</b>
<p>The filesystem in which the database environment is being created is an
NFS or other remote filesystem.  Database environments should not be
created in NFS filesystems.  See the <a href="../../ref/env/remote.html">Remote filesystem</a> section of the Reference Guide for more
information.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>There are core dumps or garbage returns from random Berkeley DB operations.</b>
<p>The application is failing to zero out <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a> objects before
calling Berkeley DB.  Before using a <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a>, you must initialize all its
elements to 0 and then set the ones you are using explicitly.</p>
<p>Another reason for this symptom is the application may be using Berkeley DB
handles in a free-threaded manner, without specifying the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> or <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> methods.
Any time you are sharing a handle across multiple threads, you must
specify <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a> when you open that handle.</p>
<p>Another reason for this symptom is the application is concurrently
accessing the database, but not acquiring locks.  The Berkeley DB Data Store product does
no locking at all; the application must do its own serialization of
access to the database to avoid corruption.  The Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store and Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store
products do lock the database, but still require that locking be
configured.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>A transactional database environment locks up, and no threads of
control are making progress.</b>
<p>The most common cause of this failure is a thread of control exiting
unexpectedly, while holding a Berkeley DB mutex or a read/write logical
database lock.  If a thread of control exits holding a data structure
mutex, other threads of control will likely lock up fairly quickly,
queued behind the mutex.  If a thread of control exits holding a logical
database lock, other threads of control may lock up over a long period
of time, as they will not be blocked until they attempt to acquire the
specific page for which a lock is not available.  See the
<a href="../../ref/lock/deaddbg.html">Deadlock debugging</a> section of the
Reference Guide for more information on debugging deadlocks.</p>
<p>Whenever a thread of control exits Berkeley DB holding a mutex or logical
lock, all threads of control must exit the database environment, and
database recovery must be performed.  See the
<a href="../../ref/transapp/app.html">Application structure</a> section of
the Reference Guide for more information.</p>
<p>Finally, the Berkeley DB API is not re-entrant, and it is usually unsafe for
signal handlers to call the Berkeley DB API.  See the
<a href="../../ref/program/appsignals.html">Signal handling</a> section of
the Reference Guide for more information.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>Locks are accumulating, or threads and/or processes are deadlocking in
a transactional environment, even though there is no concurrent access
to the database.</b>
<p>The application may have failed to close a cursor.  Cursors retain locks
between calls.  Everywhere the application uses a cursor, the cursor
should be explicitly closed as soon as possible after it is used.</p>
<p>Another reason for this symptom is the application is not checking for
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> errors (or <a href="../../api_cxx/deadlock_class.html">DbDeadlockException</a>
exceptions).  Unless you are using the Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store product, whenever there
are multiple threads and/or processes concurrently accessing a database
and at least one of them is writing the database, there is potential for
deadlock.</p>
<p>If deadlock can occur, applications must test for deadlock failures and
abort the enclosing transaction, or locks will be left.  See the
<a href="../../ref/transapp/put.html">Recoverability and deadlock
handling</a> section of the Reference Guide for more information.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>A transactional database environment cannot be recovered or normal
database operations fail with messages that "LSN" values are past
the end of the log.</b>
<p>The application may have removed all of its log files without resetting
the database log sequence numbers (LSNs).  Log files should never be
removed unless explicitly authorized by the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility
or the <a href="../../api_c/log_archive.html">DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive</a> method.  Note that those interfaces will never
authorize removal of all existing log files.</p>
<p>Another reason for this symptom is the application may have created a
database file in one transactional environment and then moved it into
another transactional environment.  While it is possible to create
databases in non-transactional environments (for example, when doing
bulk database loads) and then move them into transactional environments,
once a database has been used in a transactional environment, it cannot
be moved to another environment without first resetting the database log
sequence numbers.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>A transactional application is seeing an inordinately high number of
deadlocks.</b>
<p>The application may be acquiring database objects in inconsistent
orders; having threads of control always acquire objects in the
same order will reduce the frequency of deadlocks.</p>
<p>If you frequently read a piece of data, modify it and then write
it, you may be inadvertently causing a large number of deadlocks.  Try
specifying the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a> flag on your get calls.</p>
<p>Or, if the application is doing a large number of updates in a small
database, turning off Btree splits may help (see <a href="../../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_REVSPLITOFF">DB_REVSPLITOFF</a>
for more information.)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>Opening the database environment displays the following error:</b>
<blockquote><pre>Log sequence error: page LSN # ######; previous LSN ## ######.</pre></blockquote>
<p>A database update was made outside of a transaction.  Check that your
application passes a transaction handle to all opens and updates of
transactionally protected databases.  This error leaves the environment
unrecoverable, and the databases must be dumped and reloaded.</p>
