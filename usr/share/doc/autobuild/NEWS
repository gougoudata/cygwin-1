* Version 5.3 (released 2010-07-04)

** autobuild: Recognize libcheck (http://check.sf.net) output.
Patch from "Jose E. Marchesi" <jemarch@gnu.org>.

* Version 5.2 (released 2009-09-18)

** autobuild: Use "lightgrey" instead of "lightgray" on HTML output.
Reported by Yang Tse <yangsita@gmail.com>.

* Version 5.1 (released 2009-01-21)

** autobuild: Summary is sorted per build type rather than hostname now.

** autobuild: Generates standard HTML footer/header.

** autobuild: Add new parameter --inline-html to avoid HTML footer/header.

** autobuild: Add new parameter --ignore-files to ignore some filenames.
Useful when invoking 'autobuild foo/' for directories which contains
many log files and some unrelated files, e.g., index.html or similar.

** autobuild: The HTML output is now valid according to XHTML 1.0 standard.

** autobuild: Support automake make check output '1 test passed'.

* Version 5.0 (released 2008-11-25)

** autobuild: Always print summary.

** htmlify: Add new parameter --debug.

** abput, abput-sourceforge, abput-testdrive: Remove.
** abbuild, abbuild-sourceforge: Remove.
Both the SourceForge and TestDrive systems have been shutdown.  The
scripts were of questionable value anyway.

** doc: Change license on the manual to GFDLv1.3+.

* Version 4.1 (released 2008-08-21)

** autobuild: Support dejagnu self-test outputs.

** autobuild: Print time in UTC time zone.

** Autobuild is now developed in Git on Savannah.
The Savannah project page is available from
<https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/autobuild/>.  The download area
has been moved to
<http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/autobuild/>.

* Version 4.0 (released 2008-08-18)

** Quick summary enhanced to contain build status too.
When autobuild build output files for more than one project, the first
list of projects now contains status for all hosts and the latest
revision.

** A new script for uploading files to Compaq Testdrive, abput-testdrive.

** New "status" value "built" to indicate that build succeeded.

** autobuild.m4 now use $AB_PACKAGE and $AB_VERSION for package/versions.
If the variables are not set, the old default of using autoconf
$PACKAGE_NAME and $PACKAGE_VERSION (or ultimately $PACKAGE and
$VERSION) is used instead.

** Change license to the GPLv3.

* Version 3.5 (released 2005-09-19)

** The tools now use cf-shell.sf.net instead of shell.sf.net.
It seems shell.sf.net does not reach the compile farm at sourceforge,
only the project shell server.

* Version 3.4 (released 2005-09-19)

** HTML markup fixes in autobuild.

** Added --skip-unknown parameter to autobuild.
Make autobuild ignore files it cannot parse.

** abput-sourceforge uses shell.sf.net instead of cf-shell.sf.net.

** abput-sourceforge uses rsync instead of scp.

** Typos in the manual fixed.

* Version 3.3 (released 2004-08-26)

** Autobuild.m4 macro project name/version printing improvement.

** Manual now explain abput and abbuild.

* Version 3.2 (released 2004-08-08)

** Improved regexp's for guessing project name, revision, etc.

* Version 3.1 (released 2004-07-31)

** Bug fixes.

* Version 3.0 (released 2004-07-31)

** New commands used to upload files to compile hosts.
The generic front end "abput", and one backend "abput-sourceforge", is
included.  By simply writing a new backend, e.g., "abput-myownserver",
you can introduce new compile hosts that become available via the
generic front end.

** New commands used to build files on compile hosts.
The generic front end "abbuild", and one backend
"abbuild-sourceforge", is included.  Similar to how abput works, you
can write a new backend easily.

* Version 2.2 (released 2004-07-28)

** Guessing of project name and revision based on *.tar.gz names improved.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 2.1 (released 2004-07-14)

** Htmlize now works in batch mode.
This was accomplished by using htmlfontify.el by Vivek Dasmohapatra
instead of htmlize.el.

* Version 2.0 (released 2004-07-09)

** Autobuild and Abindex now combined into one tool "autobuild".

** New script "htmlize" replaces the Autobuild --html parameter.

** A copy of htmlize.el is now included and is installed by default.

* Version 1.5 (released 2004-07-09)

** abindex: Accepts directories as command line argument, not just files.
This is useful if you have too many files in a directory, so that
expanding wildcards in the directory overflow command line argument
size restrictions.

* Version 1.4 (released 2004-07-08)

** Don't include generated files in examples/.
The file names were too long, which causes problems with tar.  Now you
have to type 'make example.html' in examples/ yourself.

* Version 1.3 (released 2004-07-08)

** Added proper manual in doc/.

** Added example from the tutorial, in examples/.

* Version 1.2 (released 2004-07-08)

** autobuild: Values specified on the command line are now used for all
files read, when multiple filenames are supplied on command line,
instead of just for the first file as was the case before.

* Version 1.1 (released 2004-07-07)

** Fixed minor bugs discovered while writing tutorial web page.

* Version 1.0 (released 2004-07-07)

** Initial release.
