Autobuild is a package that process build logs generated when building
software.  Autobuild is primarily focused on packages using Autoconf
and Automake, but can be used with other build systems too.  Autobuild
generates an HTML summary file, containing links to each build log.
The summary include project name, version, build hostname, host type
(cross compile aware), date of build, and indication of success or
failure.  The output is indexed in many ways to simplify browsing.
