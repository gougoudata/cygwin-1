------------------------------------------
Version : 2.0.1
Due : 2001-08-26

* Move the build process to a 3-number versioning scheme. (christoph)

  tarballs. (christoph)
* Verify that 'man9' is not missing in dist/rpm/libggimisc.spec.in (christoph)

------------------------------------------
Long-term plan
------------------------------------------

1) fbdev waitretrace needs work, especially, prevent hangs using 
   a reasonable timeout, and return an error code if that expires.
   (svgalib could probably use this too, but an alarm would
    be needed to do it since once we call vga_waitretrace, we
    are at the mercy of svgalib.)

2) Integrate with LibGAlloc

3) Add Border/overscan color setting

4) Add font cell loading/storing

5) Better define the API functions

6) Persuade people who do fbdev work to either implement, or properly
   signify that they do not implement, splitline.
