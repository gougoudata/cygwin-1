This is Automake, a Makefile generator.  It was inspired by the 4.4BSD
make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the
GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets.

Automake is a Perl script.  The input files are called Makefile.am.
The output files are called Makefile.in; they are intended for use
with Autoconf.  Automake requires certain things to be done in your
configure.in.

Variable assignment lines in Makefile.am pull in defaults from various
little *.am files.

To use Automake, replace your Makefile.in files with Makefile.am
files.  Read the documentation to see what to do.

This package also includes the "aclocal" program.  aclocal is a
program to generate an `aclocal.m4' based on the contents of
`configure.in'.  It is useful as an extensible, maintainable mechanism
for augmenting autoconf.  It is intended that other package authors
will write m4 macros which can be automatically used by aclocal.

The mailing list automake@gnu.org is for discussion of
Automake, Autoconf, and other configuration/portability tools (e.g.,
libtool).  Write to automake-request@gnu.org if you want to
join.

Automake has a page on the web.  See:
