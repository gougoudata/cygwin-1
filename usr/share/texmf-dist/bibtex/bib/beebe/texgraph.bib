%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The), followed by the last two digits of
%%%                        the publication year.  If there is a volume
%%%                        entry, it is appended to the tag, prefixed
%%%                        by a hyphen.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        This scheme is systematic enough that it
%%%                        can be programmed: most of the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley book entries were created
%%%                        with an awk program from a dump of the AW
%%%                        database supplied by Mona Zeftel.  Older
%%%                        entries in this bibliography were modified
%%%                        on 28-Nov-1990 to conform to this tagging
%%%                        scheme.
%%%
%%%                        The choice of a limit of 3 letters was
%%%                        determined from experiments on the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley collection.  Long tags are
%%%                        undesirable because they are a nuisance to
%%%                        type, and also interfere with the tagged
%%%                        bibliography output produced using the
%%%                        LaTeX showtags style option.
%%%
%%%                        Journal article tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-volume-number-page, where the
%%%                        author part is the last name of the first
%%%                        author: for example,
%%%                        Bhattacharya:PR203-1-203.
%%%
%%%                        Where systematic numbers are available,
%%%                        technical report tags should look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-number: for example,
%%%                        Billawala:STAN-CS-89-1256.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility.",

%%% NB: TeX normally will not hyphenate words connected by a dash, and

                 pixels that approximates the envelope of a convex brush
                 shape with respect to a given trajectory. Let the
                 digitization of a planar region be the set of pixels
                 whose centers lie inside of it. We develop mathematical
                 models for the width of digitized brush strokes, and we
                 give a class of polygonal brush shapes such that the
                 width of their envelope with respect to a given
                 trajectory is accurately reflected by the digitization
                 of the envelope. Polygonal brush shapes also have the
                 advantage that it is usually much easier to compute the
                 digitization of the envelope with respect to a given
                 trajectory. We present fast algorithms for
                 approximating a given brush shape with an appropriate
                 polygon so that the digitization of the envelope of the
                 modified brush will have more accurate and uniform
                 width than the digitization of the exact envelope
                 would. We also present an algorithm for finding a set
                 of pixels that represents the envelope of a dynamically
                 changing brush while preserving accurate and uniform
                 stroke width. This algorithm finds a polygonal path
                 with simple rational slopes that is digitally
                 equivalent to the given trajectory. Other possible
                 applications of this polygonal representation include
                 smoothing digitized curves, data compression, and curve
                 fitting.",

%%% The question: "Is there anything like TEXCAD, TEXDRAW for Suns?"
%%% The answer: Yes, indeed, it is called FIG (Facility for Interactive Gene-
%%% ration if figures) and runs under Sunview (fig) or X11 (xfig).
%%%
%%% The source code is available via ftp on nearly any better unix-server,
%%% e.g. Passau (forwiss.uni-passau.de) or Stuttgart
