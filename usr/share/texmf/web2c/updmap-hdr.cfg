# 
# The updmap.cfg in this tree (TEXMFDIST) is generated by tlmgr by
# concatenating updmap-hdr.cfg with all updmap.cfg files found.
#
# To make local customizations to the map files, using one of the
# following methods is simplest:
#
# 1) run
#       updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map
#    for each map file.  (Or MixedMap instead of Map, if your font has
#    both Metafont and outline definitions.)  See the updmap --help
#    documentation. This will add lines to the updmap.cfg file in
#    TEXMFSYSCONFIG (creating it if necessary).
#
# 2) put all your additional fonts into TEXMFLOCAL, edit
#    TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap.cfg, and run updmap-sys.
#
# See the output of updmap --help and/or
# http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html for more.
# 
# In any case, manual edits to TL's updmap.cfg files, psfonts.map,
# pdftex.map, etc., will be lost on update.  So don't do that.
#
# The default settings of the updmap options (not maps) are specified in
# TEXMFMAIN/web2c/updmap.cfg and can be overridden by an updmap.cfg in
# any other tree.
