# Originally written by Thomas Esser, 1998. Public domain.
#
# As of TeX Live 2008, the final fmtutil.cnf is generated by
# tlmgr generate fmtutil.  You can use
# tlmgr generate fmtutil -localcfg /some/file to make local additions.
# See tlmgr --help for more info.
#
# The format of the table is:
#
# format  engine  pattern-file  arguments
#
# The last "argument" must be the name of the file on which to run
# the ini-engine (such as initex).  If the ini-engine is e-TeX, and the
# e-TeX extensions should be enabled, the filename must be prefixed with
# a * character.
# 
# fmtutil always passes the -ini option to the engine.
# If no pattern-file is desired, use -.
# Either spaces or tabs can be used as separators.
# 
# Other notes:
# 1) tex and amstex just load hyphen.tex. No customization.
#    You can have your own customized (via babel's hyphen.cfg)
#    formats on top of plain by using "bplain.tex" instead of
#    plain.tex (see e.g. bplain.ini file for bplain format).
#
# 2) etex-based formats load language.def, not language.dat.
#
# 3) The symbolic link to the right engines (e.g. bplain -> tex)
#    is generated by the "texlinks" script.
# 
# 4) usual comments start with "# ", whereas disabled configurations
#    start with "#! " in this file.
