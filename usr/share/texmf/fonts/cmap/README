In the pTeX distribution, there is also a ptetex subdirectory here, with
the files Adobe-Japan1-UCS2, H, UniCNS-UTF16-H, and more, which come
from Adobe.

Since they are under a nonfree license, they are not included here, but
they can be found in the GPL Ghostscript distribution, or via Adobe's
"CMaps for PDF 1.4 CJK Fonts" at
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/font/index.html#pcfi,
among other places.

This is unrelated to the cmap LaTeX package.
