The idea behind these files is to define map entries for the 35 standard
PostScript fonts, in the 8r and 8y encodings.  Different applications
need slightly different files.

We support both encodings here, instead of using the .map files from the
ly1 package, because updmap supports various options to transform names
between Adobe-style and URW-style, in order to support downloadable
vs. assuming built-in fonts in the output from dvips, pdftex, etc.
Those options apply to these *35.map files only, so anything about them
should be included here for best results.
